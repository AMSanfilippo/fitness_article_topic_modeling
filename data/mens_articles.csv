0,"This workout is like a car wreck. As you drive by, the cops tell you to keep moving because there's nothing to see. But you can't look away. Created by <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/mt/muscle.htm"">MuscleTech</a>- and Bodybuilding.com-sponsored athlete Abel Albonetti, this brutal shoulder workout is going to be super tough, with lots of volume and lots of dropsets, supersets, triple dropsets, and static holds. They're all intended to build those big, round shoulders you'd drive a thousand miles for. <strong>Warning:</strong> Albonetti recommends doing this workout only once a month. This is too much volume to do every week. With each set you do, increase the weight as you decrease the reps until you get to the last set, your triple dropset. Take each dropset to complete failure. Albonetti wants you to do these exercises in a squat rack with the safety rack set at about shoulder height. This will allow you to move quickly from the presses to the side raises. Do a set of presses followed immediately by a set of lateral raises, bringing up the dumbbells until your forearms touch the safety racks. The lateral raises should be performed as dropsets, so when you fail with your starting weight, replace those dumbbells with a lighter pair. After you hit failure on the second dropset, lift up your unweighted arms and press them against the underside of the safety racks and hold for a 20-second isometric squeeze. Aim for 4 sets of 10 reps. Every set will be a dropset. Go to complete failure, which should be after 6-8 reps. Albonetti's tortured twist on the cable shoulder press is to do 8 reps with one arm, 8 reps using the other arm, and then 8 reps with both arms. Adding to the challenge, he wants you to hold the arm that isn't lifting in a locked-and-loaded position for those 8 reps. Albonetti starts with a different arm each workout to prevent one arm from becoming dominant. Albonetti does standing low-pulley delt raises while leaning to maintain continuous tension on the working shoulder. He also runs the cable between his legs, which helps him hit his mid delt harder. He chooses a weight that causes him to fail between 12-15 reps, then he bangs out some partial reps. Again, switch arms with each consecutive set to balance your development. Finish the giant set with 12-15 reps of cable rear delt flyes. When you finish the last set, do a triple dropset. For this exercise, Albonetti wants you to keep the cables as high as the apparatus allows, then cross them over as you lift. Don't let the weight pull the handles behind the plane of your torso during the negative. Use the same dumbbells to do your front and side raises. Choose a pair 5 pounds lighter for the incline reverse dumbbell flyes. When you do the dumbbell front raises, your palms should face down. As you raise the dumbbells, twist your wrists slightly until your pinkies are slightly higher than your thumbs. Albonetti has you doing reverse flyes on an incline bench because it eliminates momentum, focusing all your effort on the rear heads of the deltoids.",Abel Albonetti's Total-Shoulder-Builder Workout
1,"It's exciting to start a leaning-out cycle because you probably have an image in your mind of what the results will look like: a tight, muscular physique, one that enables you to wear whatever you want without worrying about how it fits. How awesome will that be? Then reality sets in. You think about the endless hours of treadmill work that it will take to reach your goals. And your motivation begins to fade. Is there a better way? Yes. Use weight training to not only build muscle but also burn off a layer or two of body fat. By pushing yourself to crank out more reps, your heart rate goes up, your body temperature rises, and you'll burn more calories than you ever thought possible. This 28-minute workout has precisely that goal in mind. It's based on a lifting concept called AMRAPs, short for ""as many reps as possible"" done within a specific period of time. One reason this workout is perfect for shedding body fatis that it works most of your body. You've likely read about full-body workouts and the benefits they offer. Work more muscles in less time, and get a more complete workout than a standard split. <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/3-full-body-workouts-for-cutting-body-fat.html"">Full-body workouts</a> can help you <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/10-best-ways-to-lose-fat-faster.html"">burn more calories</a> before and after your workout. Here, you'll start with the big muscle groups of the lower body and work your way up. For each move, select a weight that you'd normally do for 20-25 reps before failure. Perform each exercise for 5 minutes straight. Once you're ready, start the clock and begin repping. Remember, this is a timed workout, not a ""for time"" workout, so do not sacrifice form by letting speed take over. Once you reach failure, rest a few seconds until you feel you can go again, whether that's in 5, 10, or even 20 seconds. The goal is to push yourself to do <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-simple-strength-trick-to-get-the-most-out-of-heavy-lifts.html"">as many reps as you can</a> before the five minutes is up. Once time runs out, rest for 2 minutes and move to the next exercise. Repeat this 5-minute protocol and 2-minute rest period for all four exercises. By the end, you'll have performed a 28-minute, full-body HIIT session. Do this workout once or twice a week in place of whatever you would normally do for cardio. In just a few short weeks, you'll be totally shredded and ready to go. Here's why I chose each exercise, along with a few tips on how to perform them as effectively as possible: Machines help you maintain form and minimize injury risk, both of which will be important with a heavy, high-volume workout like this. The leg press puts more emphasis on the quads, which are the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-time-tested-strategies-to-boost-your-bench.html"">bigger, more powerful muscles</a> in the legs. Place your feet at a height on the sled that helps you best isolate your quads. Whenever you train quads, balance that effort with hamstring work. Maintain constant tension on your hamstrings throughout the set. This exercise targets your lats, rear delts, and bicepsâbasically every ""pull"" muscle in your upper body. Don't be afraid to pull heavy; if you need straps to help with grip, go for it. If you want to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-unusual-gym-tools-to-build-serious-grip-strength.html"">work on grip strength</a>, leave the straps in the gym bag and push through without helpâor rather, pull through. The incline press attacks the pecs, front delts, and triceps. An incline machine offers more control than free weights, allowing you to lift heavier and for greater volume. If you don't have access to one, load up a <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/smith-machine-training-tip-watch-the-angles.html"">Smith machine</a> and slide an incline bench under the bar. If you don't have access to a Smith, use dumbbells. I don't recommend the barbell version because by now you'll be tired and you might get stuck. Even with a spotter, don't risk it with a workout like this.",The 28-Minute AMRAP Workout To Build Muscle And Burn Fat
2,"There's one thing every perfectly-proportioned lifter's body must have: that sleek V-taper. Your back and shoulders have plenty to do with it, sure, but your chest matters, too! IFBB Physique pro Stephen Mass has seen his fair share of bodybuilding competitions, and like many pros out there, he knows how to build a chest that stands out from every angle. Even if you're not planning to step onstage, this workout will help you build mass right where you need it by targeting every angle of your chest. Each pair of exercises targets the chest from a specific angle using a press and fly combination. Look at it this way: If it can make a guy whose last name is Mass feel the burn, you'd better believe it'll work for you. You'll start with an incline superset to focus on the upper chest. Stay in moderate rep range of 8-12 reps per set, building your way up, meaning you're not hitting failure until the last set. After each set of presses, go straight into the flyes. ""What I like to do sometimes on the incline flyes is to stand up so the top of my chest is basically in line with the top of the bench,"" says Mass. ""I kind of hang my head back and I really try to focus right along that upper portion of the chest. That's going to accent that <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/build-your-classic-v-taper.html"">V-taper</a> look that we're going for."" This superset burns like crazy, and you'll really feel the stretch across the upper chest. Working the upper pecs is about creating that shelf near the collarbone, and it can take some practice to get it right. ""I play with the variations,"" Mass adds. ""One that I really like to do is hold [the weight] at about a 45-degree angle with the hands."" You're using dumbbells, not a machine, so you're not going to get <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/8-tips-for-getting-crazy-ripped.html"">consistent resistance</a> all the way to the very top of the movement. Mass uses his 45-degree grip to build a stronger mind-muscle connection and really flex it out at the top. Just really try to focus on every rep, flex at the top, and don't let the dumbbells touch. The leverage or hammer press offers a safer alternative to the traditional barbell flat bench for intense, high-volume training. Since you don't have to worry about stabilizing a barbell or dropping dumbbells, you can really stretch out on both of these exercises and push your limits. This superset targets the middle of the chest, working the broader, fan-shaped pec major muscles. You're definitely going to feel it working the larger part of the muscle. ""Because we're supersetting, we're getting a little extra build-up of lactic acid in the muscles,"" explains Mass. ""It's going to burn a bit more, and you're pushing past that barrier of just doing a straight set and resting."" In this superset, you're doing a compound movement firstâalmost to failureâand again go right into an isolation movement. This overloads the muscles, creating microtears and filling it up with the blood it needs to grow. Push yourself to failure on the last superset, doing more of a controlled failure on the pec-deck, because it is an isolation movement and you don't want to injure your pecs. For the final superset, you're doing decline bench press and high-to-low cable flyes, working on the lower portion of the pec and the insertion point. When working the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-8-best-dumbbell-moves-for-chest-development.html"">lower pecs</a>, form is critical. You must keep your chest up and shoulders retracted to ensure your pecs do the work and not the supporting muscle groups, especially on the cable fly, where it's very tempting to swing your body. Keep your movements slow and controlled, and work up to failure on the final set. After doing an incline superset, a flat superset, and a decline superset, we've attacked the entire pectoral muscle, leaving a nice, full chest, and accenting that V-taper we're going for. Failure, full range of motion, fatigueâwe've given the chest everything it needs to grow, from every angle. Remember, the goal of this workout is to shape that V-taper, so you're going to finish off the chest day with a couple of pyramid sets of lateral raises. The two sets we're doing for shoulders is really 5 sets in one. Perform 10 reps with a light weight, 10 reps with medium, 10 with heavy, back down to medium, back down to light. Go through this up-down pyramid twice, and you're done!

3,"A pair of strong, sculpted shoulders is shorthand for, ""Don't mess with meâ¦unless I ask you to."" Having big show muscles is one thing, but a strong upper frame tells the world you're serious about your physique. So, we recently invited four top trainers to come to Bodybuilding.com headquarters in Boise, Idaho, to take us through their best workouts for shoulders. You've got some choices to make, so give each workout a try and see which ones work best for you! Keep your shoulders level, your core engaged, and your body still throughout this movement. Stand next to a squat rack or other machine with your feet together. Grab onto the machine and lean away. This is your starting position. Perform the raises slowly and under control. Keep the shoulder lifting the weight away from your ear. Do these flyes ""T-Y-I"" style. For the ""T"" position, move your arms out to the side at 90 degrees to form a ""T"" with your body. Next, move your arms forward until they are at 45 degrees to your head for the ""Y"" position. To form the ""I,"" move your arms farther forward until they are along your ears and straight ahead. Those three moves equal one single rep. Keep your body still and don't cheat the move by swinging your arms before lifting. Stand up straight and stillâmake the movement come from only your shoulders. Swap the bar for a D-handle and do these push-downs one arm at a time using a pronated grip (palm facing floor). With your elbow bent 90 degrees, push the grip down until your arm is extended. Give your triceps a big squeeze at the bottom of the movement. Skullcrushers are all about control. Keep your elbows in place and move only your forearms and hands. Do these quickly to warm up for the lifts. If you're using heavy weights, save your back by using your thighs to move the dumbbell into position. Rotate your wrists so your palms face forward. Use a neutral grip (palms inwards, thumb pointing forward) to hit your front deltoid. If you want some extra work on this one, take a tip from Rodney Razor and don't lock out your arms at the top of the press. Stop short of full lockout to challenge your arms and your shoulders. Maintain good posture throughout the exercise. Achieve a good contraction at the top of the movement, then take 2-4 seconds on the negative. Like what you see? Check out Meg's strength program, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/workout-plans/about/uplifted-build-muscle-and-strength-with-meg-squats"">Uplifted</a>! Do a slow (2-4 second) negative on this exercise, keeping the weights under control as you lower them toward the floor. When you're able to do 12 reps, increase the weight. Choose a weight that allows you to do slow negatives. For a more advanced movement, stop before your arms are fully extended and hold the weight there for more time under tension. Don't take the weights below your ear. Don't lock out your arms on the positive. Go slowly. Razor's ""<a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/fitness-360-rodney-razor-razor-sharp-training.html"">Razor-Sharp Training</a>"" offers insight into bodybuilding nutrition, how to do ""cardio in disguise,"" and a four-day major body-part-split training regimen. Stand erect with shoulders back, chest up. Move only your forearms and hands. Maintain good posture. Don't bring the weight down any lower than your ear. Don't lock out your arms at the top. Take this one nice and slow to get a full biceps stretch at the bottom and a good triceps stretch at the top. Keep your body still as you do these raises. No momentum or body English allowed. Do these presses one arm at a time. Keep your elbows in. Don't lock out your arms at the top.

4,"Kris Gethin had been overdue for a shoulder surgery for a long time, and postponing it simply was no longer an option. But when the date was finally just over the horizon, he didn't wallow in impending doom. He said farewell to shoulder training in the most <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/kaged-muscle.html"">Kaged Muscle</a> way imaginable: He invited Kaleb Redden, one of the docs who would be in the procedure, to join him for a 400-rep deltoid salute. Starting with the rear delts and moving forward, the pair went through 12 sets of dumbbell workâwith plenty of dropsets mixed in, of courseâbefore ending on a Gethin fave, shoulder presses on a hack squat machine. Just a warning, though: If you do try to hang with these two experienced bodybuilders rep-for-rep, prepare to be hanging out at the light end of the dumbbell rack. ""We didn't go crazy heavy on weight. We just kept the intensity very high, kept the rest periods minimal, and kept the volume up as well. So, you may look at the weights and go, 'That's not that bad.' Try to match us for the reps, and the rest periods,"" Gethin says. The entire workout should take no more than 30-45 minutes tops, even if you stop to swap shoulder-injury war stories in the second half like Kris and Kaleb did. But even with that pause, this is a true delt-melter. ""If you can't drink your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/kaged-muscle/in-kaged.html?skuId=KAG4690241"">In-Kaged</a> or you can't pick your nose, you know you're on the right track,"" Gethin says. This is a classic Gethin-style compound set: 20 strict reps with the chest supported, followed by 20 reps allowing a touch of momentum. To make it work, though, you need to make sure that your strict reps are actually strict. ""Don't squeeze your traps too much,"" Gethin advises. ""Don't raise up, don't raise back. Raise out. Make sure it's all delts, no back."" A training partner can further help by cuing you to hit their hand with the weight in the right position. ""A lot of people neglect their rear delts. That's why I like to start with it. And it's the exercise that doesn't bother me at all, so I like to warm up with that exercise,"" Gethin says. Any doubts about your form? Go lighter. This isn't the Olympics of rear delt flyes. And that last set, Gethin says, is the money set. It's basically 80 reps without more than a couple of seconds of rest in the middle. If prioritizing rear delts is new to you, expect to have yours crowing at you like roosters when you wake up tomorrow morning. Get ready for light weights to feel seriously heavy. The seated lateral raises are nothing out of the norm, except that you'll be doing a double dropset with each setâso 15, 15, and 15. Stepping down in increments of 10 pounds is just about right. If you have to use straps in order to keep your grip from limiting you, do it. And if you have to think of your 15 reps as 3 sets of 5 with a brief rest-pause in each one, do that, too. After that, you'll use some seriously light weightsâKris and Kaleb use 10sâfor 15 reps of a standing lateral raise that ends with the weights meeting in front of the chest. ""These are the ones that are going to hurt, man,"" he promises. ""As soon as the form starts to falter, rest and re-align so you can get it right."" Two rounds of this should feel like more than enough. The dumbbell front raises are performed one-and-a-half-rep style. That means you'll go to around chest level, and then to just above eye level, to count as one rep. If holding a single dumbbell puts too much strain on the front of your shoulder, use two very light dumbbells instead. After that, do the flipside of how you ended your last superset. You'll start with a light double-dumbbell front raise, then bring the dumbbells out into a lateral raise. Keep your palms facing down through both movements. Your shoulders should already be cooked by now. But you've got one more stop: a shoulder press machine for 3 burnout sets of 20 using light weight. Kris favors a hack squat-style machine, but if the sled on your gym's hack squat is too heavy, you could use cables, a landmine, or a simple shoulder press machine instead. What's the advantage of using a leg machine? ""You can target the part of the delt that you wish, whether you really lean into it to get more of your side delts, or come back a little bit so you're pressing with a bit more of the front delts,"" Gethin says. Yes, you'll have to do these with seriously light weights to be able to last 20 reps. But Gethin promises that all this light work will help you move heavier weight down the line. ""I find a lot of people train shoulders a little bit too heavy,"" he says. ""They have too much momentum, and they don't activate the delts as much as their traps or their rhomboids or pecs. Going a little lighter every now and then gets you a better neuromuscular response, so when you do go heavy, you know exactly how that exercise should feel. That's 400 reps, and that's a wrap. If you can get a shaker bottle to your face, then go the extra distance and give yourself a well-earned pat on the back.",Get Wide Or Die Trying With Kris Gethin's Delt-Destroying Dumbbells
5,"Bodybuilding.com Signature athlete Tanner Hobbs has a simple approach to fitness: Life is too precious not to feel confident in your own skin. As a successful online fitness coach, Hobbs is on a mission to help you build the body you want with simple, fun workouts that don't require tons of time or extra equipment. For this workout, all you need is a cable-cross stack and a couple of attachmentsâthat's it! This workout takes about 45 minutes from start to finish, so keep those rest periods between 45-60 seconds, and let's get to it! Many a great back workout starts with pull-ups or <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/sexy-back-jessie-hilgenberg-back-workout.html"">pull-downs</a>. For this workout, Hobbs selects the wide-grip option to target the lats. Since it can be tricky to feel this exercise in the right muscles, Hobbs has a few tips to help. ""Squeeze your elbows down and in toward your tail bone,"" she recommends. ""And keep your chest up."" If it's a struggle to complete 8 reps, the weight is too heavy. If you can easily get to 10 reps and even do a few more, the weight is too light. Use your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/other7.htm"">first set</a> to see where you're at, and adjust as needed. For this second exercise, use exactly the same setup as the first, but flip your grip so your palms face you, and move your hands closer together. A narrow-grip pull-down is great for targeting the middle of the back, including several important postural muscles. If you've never done a narrow-grip pull-down before, Hobbs suggests keeping your elbows squeezed in toward body. Another helpful tip is to lift your chest up to the bar as you pull it down. This will keep your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/ladies-6-exercises-for-sexy-and-shapely-shoulders.html"">shoulders</a> down and prevent you from using momentum to pull the bar. Also called a straight-arm pull-over or pull-through, this exercise is great for isolating the lats, since you can't use your arms to help. Go lighter on isolation exercises at first, so you can learn the movement and make sure you're targeting the right muscles before going heavier. Stand in front of the cable and grip the bar with an overhand grip, hands about shoulder-width apart. You can also use a rope attachment for this exercise if you prefer. Some people like to hinge forward from the hips for <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/5-stretches-every-lifter-needs-to-do.html"">better range of motion</a> and a stretch through the shoulders at the top. ""Either way,"" Hobbs says, ""keep you core tight and really focus on your lats as you pull down."" Upper-back details can be difficult to etch and reveal, which is why focused exercises like the face pull are a must for your back routine. Use the rope attachment for this exercise and stagger your feet so you don't swing as you pull the weight. Hobbs recommends keeping your elbows high throughout the movement, but try not to shrug your shoulders. ""Keep your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/posture-power-how-to-correct-your-body-alignment.html"">shoulders down</a> away from your ears,"" she explains, as this keeps the work in the upper back rather than the neck. ""Think about squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades."" If you are dominant on one side of your body, single-arm exercises can help balance out your strength. Set the cable at a height even with your bellybutton, using the handle attachment so you can <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-ultimate-no-fluff-womens-training-guide-part-2.html"">rotate through the wrist</a> as you pull. To do the single-arm row, keep the shoulder corresponding to your working arm down and back, and rotate your wrist as you pull the handle back. ""Start the pull with your palm facing down and end with your palm up,"" explains Hobbs. This rotation engages the muscles that attach to the shoulder blade, working your mid back. Since you're standing for this exercise, keep your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/3-bodyweight-workouts-you-can-do-anywhere.html"">core engaged</a> and your body still. Once you complete 10-12 reps on one side, perform the same number on the opposite side before you rest. This exercise is performed with both knees on the floor and the cable pulley set to about shoulder height. This position makes it virtually impossible to use <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/best-beginner-weight-training-guide-with-easy-to-follow-workout.html"">momentum</a> or swing to move the weight. ""By kneeling on both knees,"" explains Hobbs, ""you take your lower body completely out of the exercise."" You can use the V-bar attachment, two handles, or even the bar, if that's all you have to work with. Use a mat or a towel to cushion your knees. Keep your chest up and squeeze together your shoulder blades. Pull the weight with your back, not your arms. Do this workout every week in place of your normal back workout, or just throw it into your split if the gym is busy and the cable machine is all you have.

6,"If you've been in the iron game for more than a day, you know it takes more than curls to build big arms. Believe it or not, the triceps make up the majority of your arm mass above the elbow, so if you want bigger arms, it's tricepsânot bicepsâthat need to be the priority. There are three heads to the tricepsâhence the ""tri"" in the name. The long head of the triceps is the one you see when you flex the back of your arm. The lateral head is the one directly behind it that helps complete the horseshoe shape. Then there's the medial head, which is the most difficult one to see because it sits underneath the other two. All three heads must be trained to develop size and strength in the upper arm. While it's basically impossible to work one head without the other two helping out, you can make sure one head does the majority of the work using exercises that specifically target each head. This workout aims to do just that. Each of the three exercises in this workout places emphasis on a different head of the triceps, allowing you to properly train and build up your upper arm the way you've always wanted. A reverse-grip exercise allows you to focus on the medial head of the triceps. You want to make sure to maintain as much tension as possible so this head does more work. For <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/time-to-grow.html"">constant tension</a>, cable movements work best, and starting with a single-arm movement helps you focus on each arm individually. This exercise also helps warm up your elbows for the rest of the workout. If you are new to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-to-program-your-biceps-training-for-pain-free-gains.html"">reverse grip extensions</a>, or it's been awhile, go light with the weight until you're confident with your form. Even if you are comfortable with this exercise, there's no need to go super heavyâchoose a weight that challenges you at about 12 reps. Keep your rest periods short. After all, one arm is already resting while the other is working. Using a neutral grip places more emphasis on the lateral head of the triceps. Doing these extensions lying down helps you isolate the muscle more than if you were standing, which is always better for targeting specific areas of the muscle. You can do this with dumbbells or a triceps bar with vertical handles. If your gym has a <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/raise-the-bar-on-triceps-long-head-growth.html"">triceps bar</a>, I'd give that the nod over dumbbells. To execute the movement correctly, lower the weight behind your head so you can maximize the stretch at the bottom of the movement. When you press the weight up, lift it away at an angle like you want to touch the top of the wall behind you. This will keep pressure off the shoulders and more where you want itâon the triceps. Add weight with each set and rest 45 seconds in between. Now that you've targeted the other two heads of the triceps, shift your focus to the long head, the most visible part of the triceps. To maximize the contraction of this muscle, you'll need to be able to flex your wrists and separate your arms. This is why the rope attachment is really the only choice for this exercise. Use the longest rope attachment you can find so you can extend your range of motion. Doing cable press-downs while kneeling minimizes momentum, keeping the work in the triceps. Because of this, your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-arm-strategies-doomed-to-fail.html"">form and control</a> will have to be tighter than if you were standing. At the bottom of the movement, separate the rope as you extend through the elbows and squeeze your triceps as hard as you can. Let the rope back up slowly before starting the next rep. You might be tempted to cheat by speeding up the reps, but don't. Extra time under tension is crucial to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/one-move-for-big-biceps-the-ez-bar-curl.html"">building mass</a>, and slow and controlled reps will help you more in the long run.",Total Triceps Development In One Workout
7,"Fitness model and <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/nla-for-her.html"">NLA For Her</a>-sponsored athlete Lais DeLeon is going to help you build the arms you want, but not just by doing a few sets of curls and calling it quits. As DeLeon puts it, the goal of this workout is to build some guns, and to do that, you'll need to include heavier movements like pull-up and pull-down variations and rows, too! These compound moves will do as much for your arms as any curl, while also helping you build strong, shapely back muscles. But don't worry, you'll still get to do some curls, too. DeLeon's workout combines straight sets of strength work in the form of band-assisted pull-ups, followed by 3 supersets to precisely target every part of your back and biceps. This workout should take you about 45 minutes, and your upper body will be burning (in a good way) by the end. Ready? Let's do this! DeLeon loves pull-upsâshe made that much very clear when she was a guest on the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/podcast-episode-6-walks-whole-eggs-and-pull-ups-lais-deleons-reasonable-fit-life.html"">Bodybuilding.com Podcast</a>. But even if you can't nail a strict, clean rep (yet), you can still rock this workout using a band. ""I love using the band,"" explains DeLeon. ""It mimics the exact same motion, and it still allows you to get great muscle activation."" DeLeon uses the band for her pull-ups, but feel free to do the bodyweight version if you can. Alternately, a training partner could give you a boost with their hands at the knee or hips. To do a band-assisted pull-up, place a heavy-duty band around the top of your pull-up bar and hook one or both knees through as you get into position. The band will to help lift your body as you perform the pull-ups, making it easier to perform the movement and complete more reps. Do 3 sets to failure, or 10-12 reps. Moving on to the first superset of the workout, you'll need a pair of dumbbells for the curls, and a single, heavier dumbbell for the row. As you curl, squeeze at the top for a brief moment before lowering the weights back down. ""I prefer to do these curls seated on the incline,"" says DeLeon. ""It allows me to isolate the biceps and avoid using any momentum."" Once you've done 12 curls, go straight into the single dumbbell row by standing up and steadying yourself on the seat of the same incline bench. Many women find that back is difficult to ""feel"" working with free weights, so experiment with your body positioning and avoid using momentum. ""It's essential to make sure you contract your back muscles on the way up and control the weight as you lower back down,"" explains DeLeon. Complete 12 reps per arm to finish this superset and repeat both exercises for a total of 4 rounds. Next up is the second superset of lat pull-downs and cable rows. ""I love this superset!"" says DeLeon. ""It's a great combo to target your back from all angles."" She uses the V-bar attachment for both exercises, keeping the focus on the middle of the back. Keep your chest up on both exercises, remembering to pull your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lais-deleons-shoulder-showdown.html"">shoulder</a> blades down and back on every rep. Complete 4 sets of 12 reps of each exercise. ""I've saved the best for last,"" says Deleon. ""After this superset, you're going to be dying."" If you've never done 21s, they are killer. For the first 7 reps, start at the bottom of the motion and lift only halfway, so you end when your forearms are parallel. For the next 7 reps, start from that halfway position and lift all the way up. For the final 7 reps, do the full range of motion. After those 21s, go straight into hammer curls, holding the dumbbells so your palms face each other the entire time. Do 12 reps of hammer curls, and your superset is complete. Take a restâyou're going to need it to complete these last 3 supersets. After 4 total sets, this workout is a wrap. You're definitely going to be feeling it.

8,"Outside of CrossFit gyms and PE class, it's been rare to see anyone picking up a jump rope for a workout in the last few years, which is a real shame. Not only is jumping rope a great way to get your heart rate up and work up a sweat, it's also one of the most inexpensive and portable fitness tools ever. It's high time for jumping rope to make a serious comeback, both in the gym and in your personal fitness toolbox! This jump rope workout will only take you 12 minutes, which means you can do it no matter how busy you are. Throw a rope in your gym bag or suitcase so you can take your workout to the park, the crowded gym, or even on vacation. The key to this workout is to really go all out during each 30-second interval. You should be working close to max capacity during each work period to get all you can out of the workout. You'll need an interval timer and a jump rope for this workout. Set your timer for 18 intervals of 30 seconds, with 10-second rests between each one. You guessed it: You'll rest on the 10-second intervals and work as hard as you can on the 30-second ones. Go through the following exercises as a circuit, performing three rounds total. When doing double unders, keep your arms close to your side and avoid splaying your elbows out. Aim for just a slight bend in your knees on the jumpâno need to do a full <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/quick-full-body-hiit.html"">tuck jump</a>âso you can keep your double-under rhythm for the full interval. If you can't do double unders (yet), just do regular single-under jumps, and keep practicing! Do a full push-up, then at the top of the push-up position, bring one knee toward your elbow on the same side followed by your other knee on the opposite side. That's one rep. Repeat for the full interval. This exercise is just like a regular high knee jog, except you'll be jumping rope simultaneously. Focus on driving your knees as high as possible and going <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/what-is-the-best-hiit-workout.html"">as fast as you can</a> during this exercise. It should feel like a sprint! This is a great lower body <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/10-exercises-for-explosive-athletes.html"">plyometric exercise</a> that ties two exercises together in one killer combo move. Start with one jump lunge on each side, then follow with a low squat jump. This counts as a single rep. Do as many reps as you can before time runs out. This jump rope variation tests your coordination while getting your heart rate up. Swing the rope under once as you jump one foot in front of you while the other goes behind you. On the next swing, switch the position of your feet so the opposite foot is in front. Next, land with both feet together in a regular jump rope stance, then finally jump both feet wide in a slight straddle position before starting the sequence over again: Right foot forward, left foot forward, feet together, feet apart. No jump rope on this exercise, just a good old-fashioned <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-truth-how-to-burn-abdominal-fat.html"">core burner</a>. Make sure you keep your shoulders directly over your hands and core tight as you do these. Pull your knees up high on each rep, and aim for speed!","The No-Excuses, 12-Minute Jump Rope HIIT Workout"
9,"If you're reading this, training your arms is a priority, most likely for one of two reasons: Either you want bigger arms, or you want to improve strength and pressing power. This workout simultaneously helps meet both objectives. Perform this series as a part of your regular bodybuilding training, or add it to your pressing day to boost your upper-body power. Nothing says pushing power like the classic bench press, but this exercise has a twistâspecifically, you'll twist the way you grip the bar. Using an underhand, or reverse, grip on the bar shifts the focus to your triceps. Recruit a spotter for this lift so you can focus on the movement itself without worry. It's almost impossible to reverse bench the same amount of weight you would on the regular version, so don't even try to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-arm-strategies-doomed-to-fail.html"">max out</a> on this exercise. If you've never tried this variation before, acquaint yourself with the movement by starting with a light set or two. Once you start your working sets (meaning, the ones that count), add weight as the reps decrease. Rest 90 seconds between each set. If you've only done flat dumbbell extensions, the decline bench presents a new opportunity. The angle of the decline allows for a greater stretch in the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/build-ripped-triceps-with-this-routine.html"">triceps</a> and goes easy on your shoulder joints. Working with dumbbells means that each arm must carry its own load. This helps with <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-3-move-shoulder-builder.html"">balance and proportion</a>. If you want to change it up, work each arm one at a time while keeping the other in the stretch position. Another option is to alternate arms like you would with dumbbell curls. Rest 60 seconds between each set. Using cables allows you to keep tension on the triceps throughout the entire range of motion while minimizing recruitment of other muscles. Kneeling helps <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/super-pump-arm-workout.html"">restrict momentum</a> and prevents cheating as the set progresses. You can use whichever handle you have available. I find that the rope attachment works best because it allows you to separate your hands at the bottom of the press, slightly increasing your range of motion. Rotate your wrists and extend through your elbows at the bottom for an even greater contraction. Form is important here. If you must reduce the weight to perform better reps, do soâyour size and strength gains will be greater in the long run. Cut the rest time down to only 45 seconds between sets, and <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/1-month-to-big-arms.html"">choose a weight</a> that will be challenging by the third set.",3 Moves For Monster Triceps
10,"In my <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/jim-stoppanis-full-body-5x5s.html"">full-body 5x5 program</a>, I combined the classic 5x5 scheme with full-body training. Now, I'm adding one more thing to the mixâliterally. My full-body 5x5+1 program adds one more repâone heavy repâto create an entirely new program and training stimulus. As with my 5x5 program, my 5x5+1 will maximize fat loss. It also combines two great training techniques, 5x5s and post-activation potentiation (PAP), to boost your size and strength gains. For each exercise in the workout, you'll do 1 set of 5 reps, then 1 set of 1 heavy rep, then 4 more sets of 5 reps. You'll do all 5 sets of 5 reps with the same weight. Choose your 5-set weight so you can do your repsâbut just barely. If you can't complete all 5 reps on a set, either have a spotter help you, or use rest-pause until you finish all of them. As usual in my <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/trainwithjim"" target=""_blank"">#TrainWithJim</a> series, my 5x5+1 program trains all major muscle groups in each workout: chest, back, shoulders, legs, biceps, triceps, traps, forearms, calves, and abs in all five weekly workouts. On each of the 10 exercises per workout, you'll follow the same set/rep scheme: 5 sets of 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5 reps. The first set of 5 reps acts as a warm-up before the 1-rep set. For this first set, choose a weight that allows you to complete about 7-8 reps on that exercise when fresh. Set 1 should feel fairly easy. Even so, you can still do one lighter warm-up set before the first working set of each exercise if it helps you get ready. The 1-rep set should not be your full one-rep max (<a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/other7.htm"">1RM</a>) attempt, since you'll still have 4 more sets to do after that. It should be more like a 2-3 rep maxâa weight you know you can lift without a doubt, but that's still heavy. In most cases, that's just one plate more than what you'd use for a 5-rep set. This 1-rep set is meant to prep your nervous system to complete more reps on successive sets. In this case, it's designed to help you use more weight on the remaining 5-rep sets, so you can see better gains in strength and muscle mass in virtually the same amount of time as my 5x5 program. In between sets, rest 1-3 minutes, depending on how heavy you're going and how much time you have. Because you're doing a total of 6 sets per exercise, long rest breaks can add up to a slightly longer workout. If you want to keep the total training duration in check, rest no more than 60 seconds between sets. To move it along even more quickly, use rest periods of 30-45 seconds. If you choose these shorter rest periods, you may have to go a bit lighter on weight. Complete the following five workouts on any days of the week you want: Monday-Friday, Tuesday-Saturday, or M/W/F/S/S. The choice is yours. <em>Find more great full-body programs like this in my Train With JimÂ series of articles on JimStoppani.com.

11,"If <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/podcast-episode-49-abel-albonetti-on-how-he-earned-and-keeps-those-abs.html"">Abel Albonetti</a> says this is the meanest workout he's ever done, you'd better be prepared for a serious smackdown. A MuscleTech-sponsored athlete and Team Bodybuilding.com member, Albonetti is known for his hardcore workouts, and this arm blast doesn't disappoint. During a workout that had Albonetti himself groaning in pain during filming, you'll be supersetting biceps exercises with triceps exercises in a way that quickly exhausts your arms. That's too bad, because it's going to be a very long workout. All right, campers, cinch up your shorts and let's get to it. Albonetti starts you off with 4 straight sets of dumbbell curls. Take each rep slow and easy with lots of <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/youre-not-doing-slow-negatives-on-these-moves-you-should-be.html"">good, long negatives</a>. During the concentric portion of the lift, rotate your pinkies all the way in to get full rotation at the top of the exercise. For the fifth and final set, drop the weight by half. As you do eight reps with one arm, keep the other arm in an isometric hold. Switch arms and repeat. Immediately do 7 more reps with one arm, keeping the other in an isometric hold, then switch arms and do 7 more. Continue decreasing the number of reps by 1 until only 1 remains. Do that rep with each arm to finish. Follow the same rep plan for the skullcrushers. Hold the stretch at the bottom of the rep, keeping tension on your triceps. When you do the preacher curls, make sure you're not going all the way up and losing tension. Keep that bar constantly moving so your muscles are contracted the whole time. When you're doing the triceps extension, tuck in your elbows. Don't flare them out. Go all the way down to stretch out your triceps. As with the preacher curls, don't pause at the top. Keep going to maintain tension on your biceps and triceps the whole time. On the last set, Albonetti tosses in a double <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/what-makes-dropsets-so-good-but-so-nasty.html"">dropset</a>âfor both exercises. Go to failure on these. You might not be able to do as many reps as you did at first, but push for at least 6 reps. Go all the way down on the incline curls for a good biceps stretch. At the bottom, flex your triceps to stretch your biceps to the max. After you complete the twelfth rep of the fourth set, lower your arms all the way one more time and hold 30 seconds for a good stretch. Drop the weight by about 10 pounds, rep to failure, and lower the dumbbells for another 30-second stretch. Reduce the weight another 10 pounds, rep to failure, and repeat. On the overhead extensions, let the rope go all the way back to fully stretch your triceps. After the twelfth rep in the fourth set, repeat the dropsets exactly as you did for the incline curls.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  According to Albonetti, if you can do 10 reps or more before failing in either of these final sets, add more weight the next time. Do the first seven barbell curls while standing up, moving the bar up from your thighs to parallel to your waist, then immediately sit down for the next seven curls. When you're sitting, you won't be able to lower the bar past your thighs. Once you've done seven of these reps, stand up again and do the last seven reps as full reps, moving the bar from your chest to your thighs for a total of 21 reps. Stand for all the triceps push-downs. For the first seven reps, start with the rope at your waist and push down to your thighs. For the next seven, start with the rope at your shoulders and push down to your waist. For the final seven reps, do complete reps, moving the rope from your shoulders to your thighs for another total of 21 reps. On the rope push-downs, flare the rope ends as much as possible. Alternate your arms on the hammer curls to go as heavy as possible. When you're doing the triceps extensions, as the cable goes across your body, squeeze your triceps for a full contraction. At the bottom, squeeze your arm muscles for about half a second. What better way to finish Albonetti's mean-ass workout than to strap on a pair of <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/your-complete-guide-to-blood-flow-restriction-training.html"">BFR</a> straps? You'll achieve a huge pump and engorge your arms with nutrients and blood. Position the BFR bands high up on your biceps. Wrap them with a tightness of 6-7 out of 10. Keep them in place for all 5 sets. As you do these BFR sets, rest 45 seconds between sets to create that extreme pump. Albonetti recommends doing this workout once every two weeks. There's too much volumeâand it's just too damn toughâto do it every week.",The Meanest Mean-Ass Arm Workout Yet From Abel Albonetti
12,"Far too often, we succumb to the idea that there's a single way to train for every lifter. Case in point: Want to get strongâlike, seriously strong? Then of course, you're going to live and breathe compound movements, 5 reps per set or less. <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-worlds-strongest-man-works-at-bodybuildingcom.html"">Jesse Norris</a> chuckles at these preconceptionsâand his training just chucks them. If you follow him on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jessenorr/"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> (which you really should), you'll see that this record-setting powerlifter is a true devotee of high-rep sets, even as the weights rise to where the rest of the world has to just stand and watch. There's a certain <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BOD3Qk8jag1/?hl=en"" target=""_blank"">set of 10 easy touch-and-go deadlift reps with 495</a>â¦from a 3-inch deficitâ¦using a burly axle bar and no straps or beltâ¦that remains burned into my memory. What's more, if you check out his unique split in the article ""<a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/lift-as-strong-as-you-look.html"">Lift as Strong as You Look</a>,"" you'll see that Norris also has threeâcount them, threeâdays in his training week labeled ""Accessories (mostly isolation movements)."" That means bodybuilding, baby. Seriously, how many world-class powerlifters would take a perfectly nice Friday afternoon and use it to train isolation-focused legs with a bikini competitor? Probably not many. But when Norris recently visited theÂ Bodybuilding.com gym with fellow Kaged Muscle athlete andÂ up-and-coming NPC bikini competitor <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ernapalic/"" target=""_blank"">Erna Palic</a>, the burn was on the menu. This week, no matter who you are or what you're training for, put aside your preconceptions and try what Norris deceptively calls a ""quick little leg workout."" It's just 3 supersets, 4 sets apiece, and shouldn't take you more than 30-45 minutes. Then limp home, eat up, and trust that you've given your legs what they needed. Your first set is almost like a warm-up, so go fairly light and nail all the reps on both movements. Once you move to the single-leg reps, it may take a little tinkering to find the right load to use. You should be struggling to hit your last rep or two, but still get it. ""You don't need to go heavy on this exercise,"" Norris advises. ""You're out there in an awkward position, bending straight over."" How light is light? Norris once deadlifted 826 pounds, and is up over 500 for reps regularly. He's using between 185-225 in the video. Just saying. So, don't be a tough guy. ""Keep the bar close to you. Don't let it roll out,"" he further advises. As for depth, while Norris touches the ground with each rep, Palic doesn't. But remember, this is a guy who uses a 3-inch deficit, so the normal rules don't apply to him. Just go low enough to feel a serious stretch on your hamstrings and glutes with a slight knee bend, while keeping a neutral spine. The point is the stretch. ""The idea is that you're hitting hamstrings and glutes, and then quads. Kinda like we did on the first circuit,"" Norris says. As such, he hits his reps on the leg press in a very quad-centric style: feet fairly high on the platform, shoulder-width apart, toes pointed out just slightly, and pushing through the heels. ""This is going to hurt,"" Norris promises. Of course, walking lunges are a quad and glute incinerator on their ownâlet alone after 8 sets of additional work. So yes, it'll suck. Having someone mentally push you through it, like Norris does for Palic, isn't a bad idea. As you fatigue, resist the urge to let that front knee drift too far out; just keep pushing through the heel, lean forward slightly at the torso, and try not to slip on the teardrops. The last exercise is also the simplest. Just sit down and knock out your reps, making sure to use a respectable range of motion and feel the stretch at the bottom of each rep. Now, stagger off the machine, slug a shake, and hit the showers.","The Fast, Simple Leg Routine For Every Kind Of Lifter"
13,"Rarely does watching a 20-minute workout feel so captivating, but listening to IFBB pro Branch Warren discuss his training, his career, and what it takes to be on top is an experience any past, present, or future bodybuilder should have. This back workout is straightforward, but Warren's approach makes it special. Never content to leave anything in the tank, he pushes himself to the limit, and takes us along for the ride. ""I usually start with a lat pull-down,"" explains Warren. ""It works the outside of your lats. I have to do that first to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-do-you-know-when-youve-warmed-up-enough.html"">warm up</a> before I start doing T-bar rows or one-armed rows or anything like thatâreal heavy stuff. I want to be warmed up."" Otherwise, Warren says he doesn't have a set program for back. ""I train by how I feel,"" he explains. ""Sets, repsâthey kind of change around on a weekly basis based on how I feel. I always try to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/when-to-use-intensity-boosters-in-your-workouts.html"">take sets to failure</a>, dating back to when I was competing. If I had it in my mind I was going to do 10 reps, then I got to 10 and I could do 2 more, I'd do 2 more. I would train until I couldn't physically move the weight anymore."" Sometimes, Warren goes beyond failure, using dropsets and stripping plates to keep the set going. ""Do as many as you can, pull some weight off, and keep going,"" he says. ""That's a way to completely and thoroughly exhaust the muscle and force as much blood as possible in there. That will translate into to growth."" ""Back was one of my weak points,"" explains Warren. ""When I turned pro back in 2001, I trained for that show [NPC Nationals] for about nine months, and I didn't do legs one time in that whole prep."" As a long-time lifter and pro bodybuilder, Warren doesn't spare his physique a brutally honest critique. ""I was bottom heavy,"" he explains. ""I knew that in order to win, I didn't need to just have the best legs on stage, I needed to have the best physique on stage. I wanted to be pro. So, I stopped training legs, focused on upper body, came in 18 pounds heavier from my previous show, and I won. That 18 pounds? That was all from the waist up."" After turning pro, Warren didn't jump right back into competing. He took time off, because he still felt his physique wasn't where it needed to be. He still had weak points he needed to bring up, namely, shoulders and back. ""Shoulders establish your whole symmetry,"" explains Warren. ""Especially having the kind of quads and calves that I hadâif you're not wide up top, if you don't have broad shoulders, you're not going to look right. And if you don't have good symmetry, then forget about being a pro."" When considering whether being a professional bodybuilder boils down to genetics, good symmetry, or just dumb luck, Warren steps back and looks at the big picture. ""You know, I always focus on all the things I can control,"" he says. ""Training is definitely within your control. I've done these crazy, crazy workouts for years and years, and slowly but surely, my back came up and I started winning the big shows. ""That's why I push myself so hard in the gym. I knew if I could out-work all my contemporaries, eventually I could beat them onstage. There wasn't anyone out there I didn't beat at one time or another. I beat guys I had no business beating. Genetically, they were far superior. I just wanted it more."" But is wanting it more all it takes to push yourself? ""People always ask me, 'How do you train so hard, so consistently like that time and time again,'"" Warren says. ""My answer was always that I want to win. And that was true. But now that I'm not competing, it's hard to push myself to that level. Being onstage, I never wanted to lose a competition. Somehow, that worked for me."" Never wanting to lose, always wanting to winâthese are familiar desires for every bodybuilder. ""Off-season, I remember trying to eat everything I could because I was trying to grow,"" says Warren. ""I'd be up until 1 a.m. trying to finish my food. Just cussing my food, chewing it up, drinking a glass of water, just trying to swallow it and take another bite. I did that for years. ""Then, pre-contest, you're eating seven times a day but you'll feel like you're starving. You know, I'd get up at 3 or 4 in the morning to do my cardio just so I could eat breakfast."" Warren's motto for bodybuilding glory is simple: Train smart. There ain't no shortcuts. ""If you don't have it, there's no drug, no magic pill, no secret program that's going to give it to you,"" he explains. ""Just hard, hard work. And you've got to eat right. Eating is probably 70 percent of the equation. The other 30 percent happens in the gym. ""Nutrition involves proper supplementation and proper food. That's the hard part, because you have to do it day in and day out. And if you're trying to be a top bodybuilder, it's going to take many years. You're looking at a decade-long investment of your life and time and hard work, and maybeâif you have what it takesâyou'll get there. For those chosen few that have it."" No longer competing, Warren has modified his relentless approach. ""These days, I still train,"" he explains. ""I always will train, as long as I'm physically capable of training, because I love it. ""I still train hard, but I'll be the first to tell you I don't train at that next level that I did for so long. There's no point in doing so. Number one, I don't want to get injured. And number two, I'm not stepping onstage anymore, and without that motivation, it's hard to find that extra gear."" Simply put, Warren's goals have shifted: ""Now, I want to be in shape for life,"" he says. ""I love to hunt, I love the mountainsâand when you're trying to crawl through the mountains at 275 poundsâmore than 300 with your gearâit kicks your ass. ""I've lost some weight, but I'm still training, still in shape. I'm incorporating some different types of training and some fun stuff, so I feel great physically. I feel better than I've felt in a long time."" What's changed the most in his approach is his nutrition. ""I think the main thing is I don't eat as much,"" says Warren. ""I was <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-to-gain-weight.html"">eating six meals a day</a>, sometimes seven, depending on my training program. Now I eat four meals a day, so not quite as many calories. Eating seven meals a day, if you've never done it, is a job in itself. ""I weigh about what I used to weigh onstage. And I don't look like that [chuckles]. That being said, I still want to train, I still want to be big, I still take pride in my training, and I enjoy it. Especially now with a family, businessesâthat hour, hour and a half, each day is my time. It's usually about the only time of day that belongs to me. I cherish that. It's one thing in life I love to do and always will."" If his approach to food has changed, have Warren's workouts also changed? ""I've actually branched out and started to do some other types of training back home,"" he says. ""We do what we call a 'run and gun.' We flip tires, we carry sandbags, we boxâall kinds of stuff. ""I don't want to say it's a CrossFit type of workout, but it's a physical fitness type of workout. There's running incorporated into it."" Thinking about his busy life and career, Warren offers this advice to his younger peers: ""I've seen so many of these guys and girls say, 'I can't work, I'm getting ready for a competition,' I've worked my entire life. Even when I was [the] number-two [-ranked bodybuilder] in the world, I still worked. I had a business, I workedâno matter how well I didâbecause I knew one day, this would be over. ""I was very blessed to have a very long career, but all it takes is one injury to end your career."" Though his pro bodybuilding career is behind him, Warren still has sage advice for the iron athlete of today. ""There are a lot of opportunities out there, through social media, for fitness athletes,"" he acknowledges. ""But even if you're a world-class athlete, you only have a finite amount of time to be on top. ""Be smart, train smart, don't injure yourself. There's no magic formula, no magic pills. Just hard work and dedication. ""If you get there, it's worth it. I had a 16-year pro career, and I had a blast. I had the time of my life. It was my dream, and I got to live my dream.

14,"It's the middle of the contest season and Maxx Charles has already competed several times, rebounding from 13th place at the Arnold Classic in March to 7th place at the Toronto Pro and 3rd place at Missouri's Muscle Mayhem contest, both of which took place in June. Today he's at Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym on Long Island, New York, getting started on leg day. He's just finished his first set when fellow IFBB pro and multiple 202-and-under Olympia champion Kevin English wanders over. English takes one look at Charles' intensity and grueling training style, laughs, and says, ""There is no mercy in what you do, Maxx. None!"" Charles, who turned pro via his overall win at the 2014 NPC USA Championships does train pretty damn hard, but he trains smart, tooâvery smart. He says his training is instinctual, guided by what he feels and what his body tells him it's safe to do. At the same time, he says he carefully plans every detail of his workout, with not one single rep left to chance. If his approach sounds like a raging contradiction, so what? Look at this man's physique! Ever since he first took up bodybuilding, Charles has been knocked for having an upper body out of sync with his lower body. It's a criticism he shares with fellow IFBB pros Juan Morel, Johnnie Jackson, and even the mighty eight-time Mr. Olympia Lee Haney. Don't be misled: It's not that Charles' legs have ever been weak, it's that his upper body is strong AF. He is incredibly, outrageously wide and carries a tremendous amount of mass through his shoulder girdle and on his arms. In the last few years, he's worked crazy hard to improve his leg development, but he knows he has more to go. Charles is known for thinking outside the box when it comes to his training: No simple 3-sets-of-10 man is he. The <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/bodybuildingcoms-10-highest-rated-hamstring-exercises.html"">hamstring training</a> you're about to see is just another example of his unconventionalâand unrelentingâtake on muscle building. <strong>8 sets of 20 reps; increase weight for 4th set, follow with 4 dropsets</strong> Charles steps up to one of Bev's seated leg curl machines and squeezes his considerable mass into position. His first 3 sets are somewhat conventional. With each new set, he adds another 45-pound plate, pausing at the top of each rep and squeezing the hamstring muscles before extending his legs and getting a stretch in the hams. He does 20 reps like this per set. So far so good. It's when he attacks his fourth set that you get a glimpse of what separates Charles from most bodybuilders. He starts with four plates. His girlfriend lightly grips his ankles and follows his legs as he curls the weight downward. At the bottom of the movement, she helps him hold steady for a count of two. Then it's back up to the starting position; another, briefer pause; followed by another repetition. He repeats this 12 more times. When he can't move the weight any longer, he pauses for several secondsâthen somehow rips through 6 more reps on the way to his final destination of 20 reps. As soon as Charles completes his final rep with four plates, his workout partner gets ready to go into <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/what-makes-dropsets-so-good-but-so-nasty.html"">dropset</a> mode. He strips a plate from the machine and Charles does 20 more reps. When that's done, he does 20 more with two plates, then 20 with one plate. Throughout this entire 160-rep odyssey, Charles doesn't rush it. He takes time with every rep to squeeze and hold contractions. The last set takes nearly 5 minutes to complete. It's insanely hard. <strong>3 sets of 30 reps; go to partial reps if necessary to complete all 30 reps per set</strong> The average trainer would have called it quits whenâifâhe or she made it through that fourth grueling set of seated leg curls. Charles is anything but average. He's a true bodybuilding freak in a sport where that sobriquet is often bestowed but rarely earned. Instead of resting after his 160 seated curls, he moves on to a Cybex lying leg curl machine, where he will perform 3 sets of 30 reps. He starts out with a full range of motion, squeezing the pad at the top of the movement. As his hams start to burn, he doesn't stop. Instead, he starts cranking out <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/ask-the-super-strong-guy-are-partials-the-key-for-strength-gains.html"">partials</a>âstarting out with 3/4 reps and, by the end, flinching his way through 1/2 reps. Even as fatigue grinds him down, Charles keeps the weight moving and his torched hamstrings working. <strong>9 sets of 20-30 reps; increase weight with each set through the 4th set, then decrease weight for the 5th set. Finish with 4 dropsets of 20-30 reps.</strong> Here's a perfect example of how Charles takes a traditional movement and makes it his own. Have you ever put your feet close together higher up on the leg sled when you're doing leg presses? You really feel it in your hamstrings, right? For Charles, this high foot placement isn't an experiment, it's the way he rolls. He puts his feet so high up his toes and the balls of his feet are actually off the sled. Putting just about every plate in the gym on the machine, he moves slowly to avoid over-stressing his hamstrings, taking the weight through a very limited range of motion. He does 3 sets of 30 reps, adding yet more weight with each set. By the fourth set, Charles has somehow stacked 34 platesâ1,530 poundsâon the leg press machine. There is literally no room to add any more weight. His girlfriend and a buddy hover over the machine throughout the set to make sure no plates fall off. Charles pumps out 20-30 reps with 34 plates, then pauses just long enough for his girlfriend and his buddy to strip three plates from each side of the machine. He churns out a fifth set with 28 plates, a sixth set with 22 plates, a seventh set with 16 plates, and eighth set with 10 plates and, finally, a ninth and final set with four plates. It is an agonizing 4-5 minutes to watch as Charles gets his reps with legs that must feel like they've had napalm slathered all over them.",Expect No Mercy: Maxx Charles Takes You To Hamstring Hell
15,"Short workouts are essential for fitness-minded people who don't want to sacrifice size, performance, and success by spending more time than they need to in the gym. If you've already trimmed down your exercise routine, this workout will show you how to get bigger shoulders even faster, so you can squeeze in a great workout in a lot less time. The key to mastering shorter training sessions is to minimize both the distance between exercises and the amount of equipment you need. For this workout, all you need are two pairs of dumbbells and a bench. <strong>The 12-Minute Workout for Boulder Shoulders</strong> For the first circuit, you're going to do the exercises in the order they appear above. Use heavier dumbbells for the Arnold press and the dumbbell shrug, and lighter dumbbells for the laterals and the bent-over lateral raise. Perform all four exercises while standing. Standing forces you to stabilize your body with your legs and core. You must <a href=""https://www.bodybuiling.com/content/the-ab-workout-youll-feel-till-next-week.html"" target=""_blank"">keep your core tight</a> while pressing overhead, which is why you're starting with the Arnolds, while your muscles are fresh. This time, perform all four exercises while seated on the bench. Sitting helps to better isolate the shoulders and traps, because you're less likely to generate momentum. The exercise order also changes for this circuit. Do both the lateral raises and bent-over raises with the lighter dumbbells first, then grab the heavier dumbbells for the presses and shrugs. Again, do not take any time between exercises, and <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-to-keep-your-muscle-while-leaning-out.html"">limit your rest</a> after the set to only 30 seconds. You get to make this final set your own. You've done one set standing, and one set seated, so choose how you want to finish the workout on this third round. You can do it all standing, all seated, or mix it up. As for <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/4-supersets-to-supercharge-your-arm-growth.html"">exercise order</a>, you'll do the presses and shrugs first before doing the lateral raises and bent-over raises. As soon as you finish the last rep, rack the weights and get out of the gym. If you do this right, you'll be in and out in less than 20 minutes with a great shoulder pump!",The 12-Minute Workout for Boulder Shoulders
16,"If you areâor aspire to beâa physique competitor or bodybuilder, I don't need to impress upon you how critical it is to have a well-developed back. As for the rest of you, I get that it may take some convincing. You don't see your back when you're looking in the mirror, and people don't see it when you're entering a room, so it's understandable if back development isn't at the top of your workout schedule. But ask yourself this: What do people see when they look at you from behind? Are they dazzled by a rugged, thick, flaring wedge of iron? Or is there a void between your shoulders; a flat, muscle-less expanse that cries weakness? You've got to respect your back, brother, so here are six workouts for six specific back-development goals. Choose the one (or more) that matches your individual needs, then go after it for 4-6 weeks to become a true 360-degree badass. These workouts are just the start, though. You'll find dozens of full programs to keep your back growing in the Bodybuilding.com All Access <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/workout-plans/goal/build-muscle"">Muscle-Building Workout Plans</a>. Once you master the routines here, use Bodybuilding.com All Access to take your entire upper body to the next level. <strong>Workout Notes</strong> If you haven't been giving your back the same amount of gym time and effort as other muscle groups, odds are it's lagging miles behind them. To help it catch up, focus on building pure, raw mass. Building mass boils down to working hard and heavy, mostly with free weights. Do straight sets in the 8-10 rep range, taking enough time between setsâusually 90-120 secondsâto recover your breathing rate and your strength. Heavy deadlifts may require an additional minute of rest. Aside from a general lack of back development, the most common issue is having a ""two dimensional"" back: Your back has decent width, but it's flat like a Midwestern prairie. You need to beef it up and make it thicker so that eventually it becomes 3D. This is where wrist straps come in. There's no way you'll do justice to your lats in this workout without straps. Your grip will give out at some point, your workout will be cut short, and so will your back. Heavy rows and deadlifts are what make for a thick, beastly back. Wrist straps will see to it that you can do plenty of them! A wide back is all about having the most pronounced V-taper possible. In this routine, you'll be focusing on the top of the V, meaning the upper back. Various chin-ups and pull-downs will serve our purpose. Full disclosure: Much of what we perceive as back width is merely a factor of your bone structure. If you have wide claviclesâespecially if you also happen to have a narrow waist and hipsâyou'll create the illusion of a wide back even if you don't have a lot of muscle tissue back there. Still, anyone can make his back wider if he works hard on the right exercises, such as the ones below. For all the movements in this workout routine, you'll place your hands a couple inches beyond your shoulders on each side. If you try to use the widest possible grip, such as by gripping the very ends of the lat pull-down bar, you won't achieve a full range of motion or a full lat contraction. Don't go that wide! Use a pronated, palms-away grip an all these movements, except the lat pull-downs. For these, use a neutral grip with your palms facing each other. Assuming you already have decent back mass, this workout will hone and refine it. We'll use higher reps and supersets, and target all parts of this large and complex group of muscles we simply refer to as ""the back."" Fact: The more body fat you're carrying, the less detail and definition will show in all your muscle groups. Being lean will allow you to display greater back detail, but there are some decades-old techniques to develop enhanced muscle detail separate from your body fat levels. As you go through the routine, do your best to focus more on squeezing the muscles and feeling them contract and stretch. That may mean slowing down your reps and taking as much as a full second to nail that contraction. Your goal is to feel that contraction deep down in every muscle fiber, so if you must slow down to make that happen, take your sweet time. If you've never had a lower back injury and don't deal with at least occasional lower back pain, count yourself very lucky. Few things are as painful to deal with as lower back issues. For those of us who strive to improve our physiques, these issues can have a very negative and limiting effect on our training. This rings especially true when it comes to leg or back training. When your lower back is in pain, you simply can't do everything you'd like to doâexercises you see everyone else around you doing. This doesn't mean you have to halt your back development until your lower back has recovered, it just means you need to have a plan and be mindful of what to avoid. All types of chin-ups and pull-downsâunlike bent-over rows and deadliftsâare safe lower back exercises because they don't put the lumbar spine in a compromised position under load. To make your rowing movements safe, use chest support to prevent you from arching or rounding your lower back too much. The key to keeping this workout safe and productive is to stay on the pad on all rowing movements. If you allow your torso to come off the supporting pad as you pull back, you defeat the purpose of the support. Finally, we need a basic routine for those just starting out. It should be simple, but feature time-proven exercises that have helped generations of lifters lay a solid foundation for a great back. Beginners are best served by hard work on just a handful of productive exercises. Avoid the temptation to go heavier and sacrifice form in a misguided attempt to accelerate progress. If you jump the gun and increase the weight too soon, you may be able to move the weight, but you won't be recruiting the target muscles properly. More often than not, trying to move too much weight too soon ends in injury. Master your form and strive to cultivate a mind-muscle connection. The back is the most difficult area to achieve this connection in, so take your time and concentrate on each rep. Do this workout routine just as it's listed. Avoid the temptation to add more exercises or sets, and steer clear of any advanced intensity techniques such as dropsets, supersets, or forced reps. There will be ample time for all that later. For now, master the basics and work on feeling your lats contract and stretch with every rep.",Back Workouts for Men: The 6 Best Routines for Bigger Lats
17,"When it comes to burning body fat, diet and cardio are definitely important, but the way you weight train can also have a huge impact on the amount of body fat you drop. There are five main training variables you can manipulate to increase the amount of fat you burn when lifting weights. If you incorporate these variables properly, you'll have a training program that simultaneously burns fat while building lean muscle and strength. Below, you'll find my Feel the Burn workout program, which will maximize your body's fat-torching potential. But first, here are the five ""burn variables."" Research suggests that, compared to machine exercises or single-joint isolation moves, multijoint free-weight exercises such as squats, bench press, shoulder press, and bent-over rows maximize the number of calories burned. This is likely due to the fact that multijoint exercises use more muscle groups, including assistance and stabilizer muscles such as the triceps, shoulder, and back muscles that help out in a move such as the bench press. The more muscles you're using, the more calories you're burning. A study presented at the National Strength and Conditioning Association's annual meeting in 2005 showed that subjects burned roughly 50 percent more calories doing barbell squats than when doing leg presses.[1] Also, if one of your goals is weight loss, always opt for standing versus sitting exercises, such as a standing shoulder press instead of a seated press. A Brazilian study found that subjects performing standing barbell curls demonstrated a 10 percent increase in heart rate compared to those doing seated preacher curls.[2] A higher heart rate can reasonably be expected to lead to greater calorie burning. Does this mean every exercise you do has to be standing? Of course not. Just be aware of exercises that can be done both seated and standing, such as dumbbell curls and shoulder presses, and opt for the standing version when you're looking for the greatest fat-burning effect. Light weight and high reps is best for burning fat and getting lean, right? Well, this is partly true. College of New Jersey researchers found that when subjects used a weight that allowed them to complete 10 reps on the bench press, they burned about 10 percent more calories than when they used a weight that limited them to 5 reps.[3] On the other hand, several studies have shown that when you lift heavier weight for fewer reps, you may burn fewer calories during the workout, but you'll burn a lot more calories when the workout is over and you proceed with your day. In fact, research has shown that when you train with heavy weights that limit you to 6 reps per set, the boost in your metabolic rate for two full days after the workout is more than double the boost from using lighter weights that allow you to complete 12 reps per set.[4] So, what to do: Lift heavy or go light? The answer is, both! This program gives you the best of both worlds by using heavy weight for fewer reps on some exercises and very light weight for high reps on others. Research has shown that doing reps in a fast, explosive manner can increase the number of calories you burn by more than 10 percent, compared to doing reps in a slow, controlled manner. Fast-rep exercises have also been shown to boost metabolic rate after a workout ends.[5] In the workouts below, I have you starting each major muscle group with explosive-rep training, such as power push-ups and band shoulder presses, to reap the fat-burning benefits of fast reps. For all band exercises, you'll perform reps as fast and explosively as possible. College of New Jersey researchers have also discovered that rest periods between sets has more effect on calories burned during a weight workout than the number of reps. The scientists discovered that, regardless of the number of reps performed, the lifters burned over 50 percent more calories when they rested between sets for 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes. When subjects tried to increase intensity by performing 10 reps instead of 5 reps per set, they burned only about 7 percent more calories. Even if getting lean is a high priority for you, you still don't have to give up your strength. You can still train heavy and burn more calories in the gymâand after you leave. Just be sure to keep your rest periods below 1 minute. Short rest periods will affect your strength somewhat on successive sets, but it'll pay off with the extra weight you'll be able to lose. Feel the Burn features 30-second rests on straight sets with light weights. Supersets involve doing two exercises back to back without resting in between. Researchers from Syracuse University had male subjects perform two workouts that included chest, back, biceps, triceps, quad, and hamstring exercises. The first time, the subjects performed straight sets with a 1-minute rest between sets. The second time, they followed the superset approach. The researchers found that the second approach burned 35 percent more calories per minute and 35 percent more total calories than the 1-minute-rest approach.[6] In the Feel the Burn workout, I use supersets for each major muscle group.

18,"""Speak softly and carry a whole bunch of iron."" That should be Abel Albonetti's motto. This MuscleTech-sponsored and Team Bodybuilding.com athlete has no time for spit-inflected diatribes. He's all business, quietly reducing even the fittest individuals who follow workouts like this one to whimpering puddles of sweat. All right, guys, go kill those quads. Albonetti starts off with leg extensions to force as much blood as possible into his quadriceps. He performs sets of 30, 20, 10, and 10 reps. This is essentially a warm-up, so don't go to failure. Pick a weight that lets you do all the reps with good form. Don't let the weight rest at the bottom. Maintain continuous tension on the target muscles throughout. Your rest period should be about 90 seconds. Get into the meat of the workout with back squats, one of the major leg builders that takes the kind of energy you have at the start of a workout. Before you jump into the deep end of the pool, warm up. Albonetti typically starts with about 3 sets of 8-10 reps at a lower weight. As with the leg extensions, don't go to failure. Keep your back straight and maintain constant tension in your legs. Don't lock out at the top. ""When I'm squatting, I like to use knee wraps to keep my knees warm and flexible,"" Albonetti says. ""I also use squatting shoes to help me break parallel just a little bit more. Then, when I start my working sets, I'll throw on a weight belt. These accessories aren't necessary, but I believe they reduce injury risk."" Albonetti likes to hit the front squats after back squats. Most lifters can't handle as much weight on front squats as they do on back squats, so lower your poundage and focus on maintaining a <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/3-ways-to-build-a-better-mind-muscle-connection.html"">mind-muscle connection</a> and using proper technique. ""When you do front squats, you mainly feel it in your quads,"" he says. ""Front squats decrease the stress on your glutes and hamstrings, so you can go down to parallel and get in the hole a little bit deeper."" Start with higher reps for the leg press: 20 reps on the first set, 10 on the second, and 10 on the third. Rest 60 seconds between sets. For the fourth set, do a 100-rep dropset. That's no typoâ100 more leg presses. Here's how to do the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/what-makes-dropsets-so-good-but-so-nasty.html"">dropset</a>: Stay with the same weight you worked up to with the last 10 reps, but when you hit failure, strip off some weight and go to failure again. Strip the weight again, and do as many reps as you can until you hit failure again. ""When you get down to about 45 percent of the weight you stripped off, don't go any lighter,"" says Albonetti. ""Instead, rest longer. Rack the weight, rest for 10-15 seconds, then keep repeating this until you hit those 100 reps."" From there, move directly into the lunges, which are a struggle even when you do them first thing. Doing them now will make you want to crumple to the floor, but keep your back straight and focus on form. The good news is that you can still rest 60 seconds between sets, and Albonetti says you can go light and work on your mind-muscle connection. At this point, your legs are probably killing you. Oh well, time to knock out 4 sets of 12 hack squat reps. Piece of cake! Albonetti suggests bringing your feet together a bit more than you did on the leg press. ""At this point in the workout, it's not about the weight anymore,"" Albonetti says. ""I'm not going for extremely heavy weight. This is all about the feel and focusing on that mind-muscle connection. In a workout this intense, there's always a danger of hurting yourself. The hack squat protects your body and reduces injury risk."" Now that you've had a chance to ""rest"" doing hack squats, it's back to the torture table for more leg extensionsâthis time with <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/your-complete-guide-to-blood-flow-restriction-training"">blood-flow restriction</a> (BFR) thrown into the mix. Place the band as high up on your quad as possible with a tightness of 7-8 out of 10. ""If you don't have any wraps for BFR, just do straight sets without them,"" says Albonetti. ""You'll get a decent pump, but I really recommend getting ahold of some bands and giving BFR a shot. The pump you experience is unreal."" For the sissy squats, grab a band and hang it up high. As you lean back and descend, feel that stretch in your quads before coming straight back up. Do 5 sets, going to failure on each one, which should be at a range of 10-15 reps. Rest 45 seconds between sets. Depending on your rest periods, Albonetti's quad workout can last anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half. As he puts it so well, ""By the end of this workout, you should be dead.""",The Extreme Workout That Will Carve Out Your Quads
19,"Akim Williams, one of the strongest, most muscular men in the IFBB pro ranks, rolls into Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym in Syosset, Long Island, weighing a cool 295 pounds and ready to train triceps. Coming off a very successful June, with back-to-back second place finishes in Toronto and at the Muscle Mayhem Pro in Indiana, he's ready to take his place atop the world's biggest stagesâbut not quite yet. Williams has the momentumâand the pointsâto compete at the Olympia this September, but he's got other plans. He intends to focus solely on doing what it takes to dominate a super-competitive sport where hard work is the cost of admission, but genetics calls the shots. One look at Williams and you can't help but be reminded of Victor Richards, a super freak on the bodybuilding scene back in the late 80s and early 90s who was known for his crazy mass and strength. Richards never made a dent on a professional bodybuilding stage; in fact, he chose to go to Nigeria in 1992 to qualify to turn pro. Williams, on the other hand, earned his IFBB pro card by taking the superheavyweight class and overall title at the 2013 North American Championship. He's just as strongâif not strongerâthan Richards was in his heyday, having pumped out multiple repetitions of 600-pound <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/how-to-squat-tutorial.html"">squats</a> and 700-pound <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/how-to-deadlift-layne-nortons-complete-guide.html"">deadlifts</a> with no belt or knee wraps. There are only a handful of bodybuilders today who would be unstoppable if they could put together all the elements needed to seize the stage. Cedric McMillan and Mamdouh ""Big Ramy"" Elssbiay immediately spring to mind. Williams belongs on this shortlist. Like McMillan and Big Ramy, he has all the muscle mass he needs. If he ever nails his <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/7-scientific-steps-to-camera-ready-body.html"">conditioning onstage</a>, there may be no stopping him. As a professional bodybuilder, Williams' gym is his office. And when he's in his office, he's never without a kind word or two for fans or friends who approach him between sets. Other bodybuilders, some less successful onstage or lacking as complete of a physique as Williams, can be much less approachable in the gym. Williams is friendly, and when a couple comes up to him between sets today, he's quick with a smile and some encouraging words. He even agrees to pose for some selfies with his visitors, but then it's back to his workout. Watching Williams work out is truly inspirational. Talking to him, you realize that, despite his intimidating size and strength, this is a genuinely kind and gentle manâuntil he starts his reps. Once the weight begins to move, he's a study in iron-willed focus and concentration. 4 sets of 20-30 reps Williams warms up his triceps with 4 sets of seated triceps push-downs. He presses the weight down and squeezes the triceps briefly before returning to the starting position. He carefully avoids locking out his arms to avoid the excessive strain it would impart on his joints. Instead, he keeps continuous tension on his triceps as he moves smoothly and steadily through the exercise. He aims for 20-30 reps per set to pump lots of blood into the back of his arms. 4 sets each of 15-20 reps Today, Williams will use an EZ curl bar for both exercises. He lies back on a flat bench, moves the bar into position, and grips it with his hands 6-8 inches apart. He lowers the bar toward his forehead, stopping just as he reaches the brim of his baseball cap. When he extends the weight back up, he once again avoids a full lockout. He aims for 15-20 reps. Having completed them, he lowers the EZ curl bar to his chest and pumps out 15-20 close-grip barbell bench press reps. He completes four sets of each exercise. 4 sets of 20 reps with a reverse grip and multi-exercise bar
3 sets of 15-20 reps with a pronated grip and conventional push-down bar Williams does this exercise using two different grips and two different attachments. For his first 4 sets, he uses a supinated grip (palms facing up) with a multi-exercise bar, an attachment that resembles a wide letter ""w."" He pumps out 20 reps in a smooth, continuous fashion, further engorging the muscles with blood and lactic acid. After completing the first 4 sets, he switches to a conventional triceps push-down bar, uses a pronated grips (palms facing the floor), and knocks out 3 more sets of 15-20 reps. 4 sets of 20 reps Today's triceps workout ends with 4 sets of seated machine overhead triceps extensions. Bev's Gym has a few such machines to choose from, each with a slightly different grip configuration. Williams squeezes his massive frame into one and, with his hands 6-8 inches apart, gets to work. As in all his triceps exercises, he avoids a complete lockout at the top of the movement. He maintains control of the weight throughout the range of motion, and you can almost see his triceps getting more pumped with each rep. He completes his workout with 4 sets of 20 repetitions.",Monster Triceps Thrash With IFBB Pro Akim Williams

The Bodybuilding.com All Access program <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/workout-plans/about/freakmode-alex-savva-12-week-fitness-plan"">FreakMode: Alex Savva's 12-Week Fitness Plan</a> will give you both. For the first four weeks, the program is designed to help stimulate growth by attacking body parts as a group based on prime movers and their synergists. For example, the chest is a prime mover (main muscle) on a bench press, while the shoulders and triceps are synergists (assisting muscles). Because the synergist muscles are targeted during every exercise prescribed in each workout, they'll be close to exhaustion by the time you work them individually. That means you'll only need to do a few sets to finish them off. This workout, from Day 1 of FreakMode, shouldn't take you more than 30-45 minutes. Keep the rest periods short so the sets are intense and effective.

Advancing your exercise knowledge can help you with everything from warming up to smashing PRs. If bigger biceps are your goal, use these advanced exercises to accelerate your upper-arm growth. The <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/lawrence-ballengers-big-fun-arm-blast.html"">Zottman</a> curl is a great warm-up exercise to pre-exhaust the biceps. This exercise helps you warm up all parts of the biceps, as well as the brachialis, forearms, and elbows. There's no need to go excessively heavy here. Take your time with each rep and use lighter weight. Use this exercise to help you feel the biceps working, pump more blood into the target muscles, and prepare your elbows for the harder work to come. Begin curling the dumbbells as if you're doing a traditional curl. However, at the top, twist your wrists so your palms face forward, as they would at the top of a reverse curl. Lower the weights, resetting to the palms-forward starting position at the bottom. Rest 60 seconds between each set. Thick grips work your forearms and challenge your biceps in a way that a regular bar won't. It forces the biceps to work harder. You also won't be able to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/unlock-triceps-growth-with-this-one-move.html"">lift super heavy</a> since your hands will be holding a thicker handle. Thick grip curls allow you to do a unique kind of dropset. Perform your curls to failure with the grips. Once you reach failure, take off your grips, grab the bar as you normally would, and perform at least a couple more reps before your arms fail again. The weight you select should lead to failure within the prescribed rep range. <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/3-supersets-guaranteed-to-crank-up-your-arm-workouts.html"">Supersets</a> work best if you spend less time transitioning from one exercise to the next. With this exercise pairing, there's no need to move at all or even change weights. Start by performing the incline curls with your back resting against an incline bench. Upon reaching failure, sit up, change your hand positioning, and immediately go into the hammer curl. This exercise is easier to perform than incline curls, which is why you don't have to switch the weight even after reaching failure. One more advanced biceps tip: When you go into the hammer curl, position your hands right up against the insides of the dumbbell. This will <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/build-a-chest-that-stands-out-from-every-angle.html"">recruit more muscle fibers</a>, leading to better biceps growth. Cables are a great biceps finisher because <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-arm-workout-youll-feel-till-next-week.html"">tension</a> will stay on the muscles throughout the entire rep. This is an isolation move so you don't have to use as much weight to make the biceps work. For those of you unfamiliar with this classic rep scheme, 21s are 7 half reps in the bottom range of motion, 7 half reps in the top range of motion, and 7 full reps. If your form is solid (meaning, no swinging or cheating), your biceps will burn. For another advanced twist, do these cable curls lying on the floor. Since your back is against the ground, you won't be able to generate momentum and your biceps must work extra hard to finish strong.",Advanced Exercises to Pump Up Your Biceps
22,"As MusclePharm-sponsored athlete and 2018 Bodybuilding.com Spokesmodel Search finalist Tyler Holt will tell you, little tweaks can make a big difference. In this quartet of chest exercises, Holt uses cables, dumbbells, and his own body weight to create a deceptively simple chest workout that has everything you need to make your chest grow. Holt has employed dropsets and unique combinations for years. Many of his part workouts were borne of the need to work past injuries while still maintaining his hard-earned size and strength. He knows exactly how to use tempo and time under tension to make your muscles work even when lifting lighter weight. ""We're going to tax your chest from every angle,"" explains Holt. ""I'm going to take you through pause reps and use some different angles with the cables. It's a quick workoutâonly four exercisesâthat should only take you about 40 minutes."" While a cross-over might sound easy enough, the progressive weight increase on every set is not. The first set of 20 reps is all about priming your muscles for what's to come. ""Get your muscles, tendons, ligaments warmed up with that first set,"" says Holt. Pause and squeeze at the top of every contraction. This will make sure your chest is working as hard as it can. Holt says to keep a slight bend in your elbow, and make sure to stretch all the way back. Your chest should have a good pump already as you hit the incline dumbbell press. ""The reason I follow the cable fly with the incline press is to focus on upper chest,"" explains Holt. ""In my opinion, that's what builds a nice, full chest, and it's very underworked for a lot of people."" As with the cable cross-over, increase the weight on every set as the reps drop. On every rep, pause at the bottom for 1-2 seconds, getting a good stretch in the chest. This pause increases the time under tension for your muscles, helping <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-full-body-workout-to-boost-the-big-three-lifts.html"">increase strength</a> gains and growth. Keep your shoulders down and back throughout, and don't lock your elbows at full extension. Many top athletes create their own workout <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/9-muscle-building-exercises-youve-never-tried-before.html"">variations</a>, and Holt is no exception. ""This is a totally different exercise,"" he explains as he sets up for the cable press with push-up.""Instead of just doing a cable press, or just doing push-ups, you create a more dynamic exercise for the muscle. It is just going to destroy your chest."" While it may sound complicated, the cable press with push-up is straightforward. Bring the cables with you as you drop down into a push-up position, laying your palms on top of the strap portion of the handle to hold them down. Perform one push-up, then hold your body in a straight-arm plank as you bend your right elbow and lift your hand up with the cable, then press back down in a single-arm press. Place your right hand back on the ground, still holding the cable, and repeat the same motion on your left side. That's one rep. Complete 3 sets of 8-10 reps, trying to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-advanced-moves-for-extreme-arm-growth.html"">increase the weight</a> on each set. Keep your feet wide for a better base and more stability during the cable press. Start with a light weight. Once you grow comfortable with the exercise, increase the load accordingly. Make sure you maintain a strict plankâavoid twisting or swaying as you press. If the weight wants to pull your body out of alignment, you're going too heavy. This is a twist on the standard cable cross-over, this time hitting the chest at three different angles instead of one. Holt revisits this variation of his first exercise to make sure he hits every muscle fiber in the chest before the end of the workout. He recommends working to failure on all 3 sets. Effort-wise, go for it here. Don't leave anything in the tank. Set the pulleys at shoulder height to start, then pull the cables low for the first angle. Stretch back and pull the cables to mid-chest height for the second angle. Stretch back one more time and pull the cables in one more time just above your chest at about eye level. That's one rep. Repeat this sequence until you can no longer bring your hands together with good form. Rest 1-2 minutes between sets.

23,"IFBB Bikini pro Caryn Nicole Paolini shares her brutal summer booty workout with her best friend, Canadian Bikini pro and certified personal trainer Randi Kennedyâbecause, what else do best friends do? Co-creators of Her Fit Camp, whose mission is to provide an uplifting, positive, and empowering environment for women, these ladies know exactly how to help you target your glutes so they can look great onstageâor just chilling by the pool. Aka the scissor jump, this exercise targets every muscle in your legs. To achieve more glute activation, drop into a low lunge on each jump, and explode up from your heel, extending through the hip as you switch legs before landing on the opposite side. Land softly on each rep to protect your joints, and make sure your front knee stays over your ankleâdon't let it go past your toes. Use your arms to help or, for an extra challenge, try holding a light <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-ultimate-medicine-ball-workout.html"">medicine ball</a> on your chest and using only your legs. To target the side of your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/glute-workout-6-ways-to-build-your-perfect-booty.html"">booty</a>âaka the gluteus mediusâturn to the side for this move. From this position, put your top foot on the platform, toes turned slightly up. Press through your heel and extend all the way through the hip to target your glutes. Another way to think of this exercise is like you're doing a single-leg sumo squat. If your leg press won't allow you to comfortably turn to the side, sit in the seat and put one leg up, turn your toes out, and press the weight up like you normally would with both legs. This is basically a wide-stance jump squat, but using the leg press machine allows you to control the movement and better target your glutes. Place your feet slightly wider than shoulder width, and lower yourself down until you feel a stretch in the glutes. Press through your heels as you come up and ""pop"" off the platform by extending through your hips and squeezing your glutes. Land softly to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/strong-foundations-why-you-should-strengthen-your-core-muscles.html"">protect your knees</a>, and return to the starting position. This is a great exercise to do with a partner who can help you get into position. Lie face-down on a bench with your knees hanging off the end. Have your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-reasons-to-exercise-with-your-partner.html"">partner</a> place a dumbbell between your feet. Extend through your hips and squeeze your glutes as you curl the dumbbell toward your body using your hamstrings. For an extra booty burn, try to lift the weight straight up toward the ceiling as you curl the weight, squeezing your glutes and pressing your hips into the bench as you do so. Hip hinges <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/taylor-chamberlains-signature-moves-for-glutes.html"">target the glutes</a>, and hyperextensions are an easy way to hinge effectively without needing to lift a lot of weight. If your gym does not have a glute-ham raise machine or Roman chair, use a stability ball and wedge your feet against a wall or under a machine. Keep your back straight as you hinge from your hips, not your lower back. You'll know you're performing this movement correctly if you feel the stretch in your hamstrings. Press through your heels and squeeze your glutes to come back up.",The Ultimate Summer Booty Workout

25,"When you first start training, your upper arms grow almost without trying, regardless of your approach and technique. Inevitably, though, you hit that dreaded growth plateau and realize you need to master the basics of building muscle if you still want to put on size like you used to. Building muscle isn't just about what you do. It's about how you do it. While there are many exercises to help you work your biceps, you need these four essentials to help you build them. True muscle failure happens when you can no longer lift the weight with good form. A lot of us work around this, though, by using momentum or recruiting other muscles to lift the weight. The biceps must work in order to grow, and if other muscle groups are joining the set then you simply won't maximize your potential. Let's use barbell curls as an example. As your set progresses and your biceps fatigue, you arch your back and swing the weight up, or you recruit your shoulders by moving your elbows forward. Either way, less work is done by the biceps, and your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-arm-strategies-doomed-to-fail.html"">growth potential suffers</a>. The best way to isolate the biceps is to start light and focus on proper form. If you're still having trouble isolating your biceps, lean against a wall or use an arm blaster to keep your elbows in place. A preacher bench can also help you isolate your biceps, or you can do single-arm exercises to work each arm individually. Isolating each arm makes them do more work so you reap more benefits. It's a well-known fact that if you do the same amount of work week after week, your biceps will have no reason to adaptâand no reason to get bigger or stronger. To grow, you have to overload the muscles with more volume than they're used to handling. There are a few different ways to overload the biceps, such as increasing the weight, adding sets and reps, or upping your training frequency. The problem is you can't always keep adding more of everything, so one of the best ways to overload your biceps during your workout is by performing <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/when-to-use-intensity-boosters-in-your-workouts.html"">forced reps</a>. Forced reps are exactly what they sound like: You force your muscles to do a few more reps once they've reached failure. To do this, have a partner assist you with the positive portion of the rep, then perform the negative on your ownâand do it slowly. Even doing just the negative still makes the muscles work and still breaks down the muscle, both of which force the muscle fibers to rebuild and grow so they can handle that load in the future. Many of us train biceps with an emphasis on chasing the pumpâan obsession that goes back as far as Arnold's famous monologue in ""Pumping Iron."" As great as the pump feels, it's also beneficial. Nutrient-rich blood coursing through the muscles in greater-than-normal amounts is key for growth. Since the pump is what helps your muscles rebuild bigger and stronger, learning how to use it to your advantage can seriously <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-arm-workout-youll-feel-till-next-week.html"">accelerate biceps growth</a>. Movements such as cable curls and machine curls that keep tension on the biceps are great for increasing the pump. If you want to go even more advanced, you can incorporate <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/add-2-inches-to-your-guns-by-spring-break.html"">occlusion training</a> or use tourniquets. Positioning can mean more than performing your curls standing, seated, or even lying down. When you're training biceps, it can also mean taking elbow and even hand placement into consideration. Where you hold the weight with your hands can affect how the muscles engage and how they work. Placing your hands against the inside of a dumbbell when doing dumbbell curls shifts the focus of the biceps. Neutral hand positioning, used in exercises such as the hammer curl, targets the brachialis and forearms. Going wider with your grip on barbell curls shifts the focus to the inner head of the biceps. Your elbows can play a positive role, as well. Most curls require your elbows to be at your sides. If you perform a drag curl and let your elbows drift toward your back, you can get a deeper stretchâand a better contraction. If your elbows come forward, as with a preacher curl, the short head of the biceps is more active. Adding both types of movements makes for a better overall workout and, in the long run, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/shrink-your-workout-grow-your-chest-and-back.html"">greater growth</a>.",4 Musts To Maximize Biceps Growth
26,"The name says it all: This is one brutal shoulder workout. But what feels like total annihilation for some is just another day at the gym for MuscleTech-sponsored athlete and Team Bodybuilding.com member Abel Albonetti. Known for his high-volume training and willingness to endure pain in pursuit of gains, Albonetti shares his meanest shoulder workout yet. Nearly every exercise of this workout ends in a dropset, and in some cases a double or triple dropset. A dropset is where you perform the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-shoulder-workout-that-overcomes-any-training-plateau.html"">prescribed number of reps</a> for the set, then drop to a lower weight and immediately perform another set to failure at that weight. If it's a double or triple drop, you drop down and <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/super-pump-arm-workout.html"">go to failure</a> twice on a double and three times on a triple. For example, on the seated cable shoulder press, you'll perform 3 sets of 10, then on the fourth set perform 10 reps, drop the weight, rep to failure, drop the weight, rep to failure, drop the weight one last time, and rep to failure. For the final burnout <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-to-get-six-pack-abs-using-supersets.html"">superset</a> at the end, you'll repeat the side raise and the front raise, this time using the same set of dumbbells for both. Perform the side raises to failure, then front raises to failure before resting, then repeat for 4 total sets. For an extra burn, hold the weights up as long as you can at the end of each set, increasing the time your shoulders spend under tension.",Abel Albonetti's Brutal Mass-Building Shoulder Workout
27,"Kaisa Keranen, founder and trainer of <a href=""https://www.kaisafit.com/"" target=""_blank"">KaisaFit</a>, is a straight-up badass, the definition of #workoutgoals. Any man or woman who can do a full-body plyometric push-up onto four tall stacks of weight plates, and can use her biceps to pop a weighted barbell up over her head deserves serious kudosâand a giant <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaisafit/"" target=""_blank"">Instagram following</a>. Keranen has earned both. To date, this smiling bolt of energy has more than 700,000 IG followers, has graced the cover of Oxygen magazine, and received accolades from Fitness, PopSugar, Shape, Harper's Bazaar, Huffington Post, ESPNWâeven Michelle Obama. It doesn't hurt that unlike many social media fitness stars, Keranen actually has the credentials to back up her workouts, boasting a master's degree in sports performance and injury prevention, as well as a performance-enhancement-specialist certification from the National Academy of Sports Medicine. Keranen played sports in high school and went on to become a member of the University of Washington's track and field team. She never planned on making health and fitness her career. In fact, it wasn't until her senior year at UW that she even considered the possibility. ""I spent my entire college career injured, frustrated, and feeling completely broken,"" Keranen says. ""I knew there had to be a better way to train, and I wanted to spend some time learning about my body so I could heal myself. I decided to get certified, mainly to train myself, but quickly fell in love with fitness training. I knew I wanted to make it my career."" Originally, her plan was to train at the collegiate level, but then came social media. ""Social media completely changed my career,"" she says. ""I wanted to share my love and passion with as many people as I possibly could, which I thought would mean coaching large group classes. Social media allowed me the opportunity to share my message with a much larger audience."" Now a bona fide social media star, Keranen doesn't take her followers for granted. She knows only too well that social platforms are saturated with fitness content and no one trainer has a lock on popularity. ""I'm grateful for every single person who decides to follow me,"" she says. ""I take my role as an online coach very seriously and am dedicated to creating new and exciting daily content to keep people motivated to move."" Keranen's ultimate goal is to help her clients find the motivation to moveâeven if they're never able to conquer some of the gravity-defying exercises she showcases on Instagram. Because she grew up an athlete, she's always moved with the intention to improve her performance. So, it was a bit of a shock when she started training clients whose goals were simply to lose weight or build ""better"" arms and legs. ""I was completely thrown off,"" Keranen says. ""From early on, I made it my mission to show people, through movement, that they're much more than what they look like. I teach people that movement is an exploration of all the incredible things their bodies can do, not a form of punishment for what their bodies do or don't look like."" Keranen practices what she preaches. After wrapping up her athletic career, her personal goal was just to pursue her career in a way that allowed her to have fun and not take things so seriously. It may come as a surprise, but she says she doesn't set specific goals or parameters around movement, and she rarely follows an exact program. ""It's incredibly freeing to just let goâto show up to your daily workout so pumped to see what your body will do and how it will amaze you,"" she says. ""I just enjoy challenging myself to find new and creative ways to move and have fun."" Part of Keranen's life perspective is to embrace flexibility in her working life and her workouts. ""I've learned never to assume you know exactly what's going to happen in your life, so you can be flexible and willing to roll with the punches,"" she says. ""If I hadn't been so open to new possibilities, my career wouldn't be what it is today."" She approaches her current workout in the same spirit. ""Who knows?"" she says. ""The next time you chat with me, I may have decided to dedicate the next year to becoming an MMA fighter or a marathon runner. My goal is simply to move every single day, to have fun with it, and to take care of my body. When I'm 80 years old, I want to be able to head to the gym or just dance around my kitchen!"" Contrary to the overworked and outdated saying that ""the early bird gets the worm,"" Keranen refreshingly admits she's not a morning person. On a typical day, she wakes up at 6:30 a.m., then gives herself another hour in bed to emerge from her ""sleep coma."" Even after she rises, she says, she's on autopilot until she finishes her toast with almond butter and a banana. She avoids early morning meetings and office hours, instead heading to the gym for a 9 a.m. workout, then heading home for lunch. Her official workday typically begins after noon, when she meets with her team to discuss current projects. ""Right now, we're working on several movement programs, plus we're designing my own apparel line, which has been really fun!"" she says. After team meetings wrap up, she turns off work for a whileânot a natural inclination for someone who loves what she does, but a necessity for maintaining a work-life balance. She gets back into her business groove at night, answering emails and wrapping up the day's work. It may not be a ""typical"" business schedule, but Keranen has learned that there's no such thing as typical when you're blazing new trails as an entrepreneur. If you're going to be a trailblazer, you had better dress the part. For Keranen, that means wearing clothes that allow her to move freely from the gym to meetings in comfort and style. ""I'm pretty sure I've tried every fitness apparel brand out there, and I've concluded there are two basic styles on the market right now,"" she says. ""First, there's the gear you can actually work out in. Then, there's gear that looks good, but is completely nonfunctional. There aren't a ton of brands that both look good and give you the freedom to move, which is why I'm developing my own line of gear."" In the meantime, she says, she's a big fan of Lululemon for her leggings. For her tops, she takes a decidedly DIY approach, regularly wielding a pair of scissors to turn normal cotton tanks into crop tops. She caps off her wardrobe with NOBULL shoes. ""I rock their high tops and am in love,"" she says. If you think you can hang with Keranen's hard-hitting power moves, give the following workout a try. Be forewarned: This is a crazy, kick-ass set of exercises. Set up a high plyometric box a few feet away from a bench. Set a slightly lower plyo box to the side to help with dismounting. Sit on the bench, then swing your arms up and lift your feet from the ground before strongly swinging your arms behind you as you plant your feet and explode upward, landing on top of the plyo box. Come to a full stand before stepping down from the box and returning to the bench. Stand just behind a low platform with a loaded barbell at your feet. Perform a power clean with perfect form, but as you perform the powerful clean, jump up and forward to land with your feet on the platform just as the bar is ""racked"" at your chest. From there, squat. As you stand up with the bar, step back off the platform and return the barbell to the floor. Use heavy dumbbells to secure two heavy resistance bands to the ground. Loop the opposite ends of each resistance band around the ends of a loaded barbell, so both resistance bands are secure. Stand between the dumbbells with the barbell ""racked"" at your chest, your feet hip-distance apart, knees slightly bent, and the resistance bands taut. Perform a jerk. As you thrust the barbell powerfully over your head, jump into the air, stretching against the bands' resistance and landing with your feet in a split position, right leg forward, left leg back. Step back to center as you lower the barbell. Perform all the splits with your right leg in front. On the next set, lead with your left leg. Perform a kipping pull-up, using a powerful leg swing to help with momentum to push you up over the bar. As your shoulders approach bar-height and you're still moving upward, release your hands from the bar, quickly clap them, then grab the bar as you begin your downward action. Continue in this fashion. Set up in front of a bench or box that's roughly knee height. Load up a barbell and use two heavy dumbbells to secure large, looped resistance bands between the dumbbells and the barbell (like you did with the banded split squat). Stand between the dumbbells and in front of the bench, the barbell loaded across your shoulders. Squat, sitting on the bench. Lift your feet from the ground, then forcefully plant them, using their momentum to rise from the bench, fully extending your knees and hips as you jump into the air, causing the resistance bands to stretch. Land softly, knees and hips slightly bent, then squat back down to sit on the bench. Continue in this fashion.",A Better Way To Train: Kaisa Keranen Reinvents Fitness
28,"If there's one thing a guy doesn't want to hear in the gym, it's someone telling him he has the dreaded ""dad bod."" It means you're not in terrible shape, but your muscles lack tone and you've got enough extra body fat to survive in the Arctic in just a T-shirt. If you're a guy who's had this term directed at you, you might have laughed it off. Deep down inside though, it might have pissed you off. Time to shed that bod and get something you can be proud of. You might be one of those guys who kept up with his training, but put it all aside to have more time with the kids. That's very noble. But it shouldn't come at the expense of your physical fitness. Being fit means you can do more as a dad: You can crawl around on the floor with your kids when they're infants, play in the yard when they're toddlers, and shoot hoops with them when they're teenagers. These are some of the best reasons to get back in shape. The following workout plan includes a weekly weight training and cardio plan to help you move from where you are now to what may be the best shape you've ever been in. The weight training workouts you'll follow aren't long, but they're intense, with lots of supersets and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) that'll help you burn a lot of calories fast. As long as you keep your rest times to a minimum, these workouts shouldn't take longer than an hour to complete. So, fit these workouts in anytimeâmorning, noon, or night. What matters is that you follow the schedule and get all your workouts in. While it's a great feeling for the kids to lay their heads on your chest or shoulder, you don't want them praising how soft you are. This workout, done properly, will start adding some serious tone to your upper body. Consider it a victory when they start asking for a pillow. Do your HIIT workout on an elliptical machine. Start with 2 minutes at a moderate pace. Then go hard for 30 seconds. Repeat this pattern for 6 rounds. It adds up to just 15 minutes, but it will be all you need if you really push it for those half-minute bursts. It is essential that you train legs hardânot just so you look good, but so you can move your body with power and efficiency. This leg workout will pound your legs into a pulp to get stronger and improve leg function. The HIIT portion of the workout will be a 30/30/30 boxing drill on a heavy bag: 30 seconds of jabs, 30 seconds of combination punches, and 30 seconds of all out power. Rest for 90 seconds in between each round. Don't sit down between rounds, though. Instead, walk around and take deep breaths. Perform 6 rounds of this 18 minutes of ""hard-hitting"" cardio. Rest, but don't vegetate. Take your kids to the park or go on a walk for an hour or so. Do something active with them so you can start to enjoy the fruits of your training labor. It can't be justÂ about the beach muscles. Getting rid of the dad bod stigma means improving your entire bodyâincluding your back. Achieve some width and thickness back there, and you'll inspire your whole family. Of course, the abs are important too and need specific attention. As the saying goes, ""abs are made in the kitchen,"" meaning that you need to lose body fat for your ab muscles to show through. But you still need to train them, so get to it! Your Day 4 HIIT workout involves the battle rope. You can choose how you wave the rope, but make sure you give it your best effort for 30 seconds. Rest for the same amount of time in between, and repeat as many times as you can in 12 minutes. Another phrase just as popular as ""dad bod"" is ""sun's out, guns out."" The flexed arm is considered the standard sign of strength, so we're going to dedicate one day per week to help you lock and load those guns. You may be tempted to swing heavier weight. Don't. The best way to grow your arms is to use manageable weight, do slow reps, and focus on the biceps contraction that happens as you lift. Your cardio for today will be wind sprints, so you have at least a fighting chance of keeping up with the young'uns. After you do a couple warm-up runs, sprint as hard as you can for about 20 seconds. Do this at a local football field or track, at a park, on a sidewalk, or in your own yardâany place you have room to build up some speed. Take about 30 seconds to walk back to the starting position and repeat. You're finished when you've done ten sprints. Use one of these days as a complete rest day, if you feel it's necessary. Tell your partner you'll get to the heavy chores tomorrow. On the next day, do some kind of activity that gets you moving. Just don't overdo it; doing so will hinder your ability to give next week's workouts your all.",Transform Your Bod From Dad To Rad
29,"When it comes to arms, the bigger the better, right? Go ahead and enter ""world's biggest arms"" in a search engine, and you'll soon find out that isn't even remotely the case. That is, unless your idea of awesome is hanging two ugly, misshapen, overstuffed gunny sacks of lumpy flesh from your shoulders. As with just about everything in the realm of bodybuilding, a few misguided folks have taken arm development way too far. Unlike, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger's bombers (which clocked in at 22 inches and flowed seamlessly with his muscular 6-foot-2-inch frame), we've seen guys over the years use unnatural means to cross the 25- and even 30-inch mark, which looks more like a cry for help than a training goal. Instead of pursuing arm girth at all costs, MuscleTech-sponsored athlete Fabian Petrina suggests a more targeted approach. ""My whole goal with training is to create something aesthetically pleasing to look at,"" he explains. ""I'm a bodybuilder, and achieving a perfect biceps peak is my goal. I want arms that look impressive but can still fit in a suit. Twenty-five-inch arms don't look good on anyone."" To help achieve that goal, Petrina has developed a twice-per-week biceps attack, once with back and once with shoulders and triceps, that focuses on quality over mass. Yes, you'll build some muscle on this programâbut you'll do it strategically, with emphasis on carving out an impressive, proportional peak. For every new exercise, do 1-2 warm-up sets, but don't overdo the reps. ""Those warm-ups sets should be 3-4 reps with about 50 percent of your working weightâjust enough to jumpstart your mind-body connection and make sure there are no aches, pains, or twinges anywhere,"" Petrina says. ""Like calves, biceps are a slow-twitch, red-muscle-fiber-dominant body part,"" Petrina explains. ""They recover more quickly, which is why I recommend training biceps twice per week, once with back and once with shoulders and triceps."" These sessions don't have to be excruciatingly long. ""On back day, your biceps training will be short and sweet, just 2 sets of 60-100 reps each,"" he says. ""You've put heavy loads on your biceps already with rows and other pulling movements, so these high-rep burnouts hit them in a different way and help you really finish them off."" Choose a weight that's about 30 percent below your 10-rep max. If you can do 10 reps with 100 pounds, 30 percent below is 70 pounds. ""Aim for doing 20-25 reps with that weight, then cut the weight in half and do as many as you can,"" Petrina says. ""If you fail before you hit at least 60 reps, cut the weight in half again so you can at least get your 60 before hitting the wall."" For both sets, use a grip that's a little wider than usualâabout one hand outside shoulder width. ""This will help hit that inner head of your biceps,"" says Petrina. ""Also, shift the weight onto your outer palms, by your pinkie, and really own the weight by going slowly. Take about 2 seconds up and 3-4 seconds down, and really squeeze the biceps at the top. Over the course of each set, you'll build an insane pump, and should really feel your biceps tightening up."" ""With the neutral grip, you'll hit the brachialis, the muscle that runs beneath the biceps, to give your peaks some lift,"" says Petrina. ""You should also twist your hands into a supinated position as you come up to the top of the curl, which directly engages each peak."" The 2 sets shouldn't take more than 5 minutes, during which you'll force blood into the area until you reach muscle failure. Two or three days later, when your biceps have had a chance to recover, hit them again with a more traditional workout. Use a standard shoulder-width grip for this superset. For your 2-3 working sets, don't pyramid up. Rather, go right to your 10-rep-max weight after 1-2 warm-ups. ""If your working weight is 100 pounds, do 2 sets of 50 pounds, 3-4 reps apiece, to warm up,"" says Petrina. ""I don't believe in pyramiding. Why would you want to exhaust yourself on a weight that's not even your max?"" Cadence is critical here. For curls, Petrina suggests a 2-second positive, followed by a 3-4 second negative. Repeat this pattern with the push-downs. Don't rest at all within the superset, but take a 60-90 second break between supersets. ""The main thing to focus on with the preacher curls is getting the most out of the negative,"" Petrina says. ""Your shoulders should be relatively relaxed because of the support, so you can bring the weight down slowly and then explode up. Use a 1-second positive, then a 4-5-second negative."" Petrina says that when you do concentration curls, less weight is more. ""Don't focus on the weight, but on the control and squeeze,"" he says. ""In many cases, I can achieve a better burn and better results with a 20-pound dumbbell than I can with a 50. The most important thing you can do for yourself on arm day is leave your ego outside and go light enough to control the weight."" You can also wring more out of concentration curls by using a wrist twist. Start with your hand in a neutral-grip position, with your palm facing the opposite leg. As you curl the dumbbell, supinate your wrist so your grip is underhand at the top. In fact, you want to turn your wrist a bit farther than that for maximum effect. ""Think of it as wanting to touch your nose with your pinkie,"" Petrina suggests. ""Obviously, the dumbbell is in the way and you can't physically do that, but that's how much you want to rotate your wrist as you reach the top."" On the last superset, do 3 sets of 10-15 reps apiece. Choose weights that cause you to reach failure in that rep range. Finish with one burnout set, dropping the weight 30-50 percent, depending on how exhausted you are. Push through 20-25 more reps. This workout regimen should work well for most people, especially beginners with a few months of experience and intermediates who have reached a plateau in their biceps development. But there's no one-size-fits-all approach. ""Try this routine for 4-6 weeks or longer to see how your body reacts to it,"" Petrina says. ""Some people might find they respond better with really heavy weights and low reps instead of this approach, and that's fine. It all depends on your muscle composition, whether you're more red-fiber (slow-twitch) or white-fiber (fast-twitch) dominant. That's why experimenting with different approaches is key.""",How to Build Biceps Peaks Of Perfection
30,"Sometimes the best offense is a good defense. I know that sounds like a clichÃ©, but it's true. If you're anything like the 20-year-old version of me, you probably believe that every workout has to be a record breaker and that doing more each time you set foot in the gym is what yields the greatest results. While this kind of enthusiasm is inspiring, it reveals a lack of experience. Not only is more not always better, but often more is impractical. Dedicating 15 focused minutes to your arm training could be a whole lot better than spending lots more time going for some major new PR. Why train your arms for 15 minutes instead of the usual 45, 60, or even 90 minutes? You may have only a few minutes to spare. Shit happens. Things come up. You might normally dedicate an entire training day to your arms, only to find yourself overwhelmed with work, family, travel, or other real-world obligations. You need to train arms regularly, but it's foolish to sacrifice <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/build-an-animal-chest-frank-mcgrath-and-evan-centopani-workout.html"">chest</a>, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/evan-centopanis-switched-on-back-workout.html"">back</a>, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-shoulder-strategies-doomed-to-fail.html"">shoulders</a>, or legs just so you can spend your entire training session on one smaller body part. Also, if you do a regular workout, you're already giving your arms indirect but significant stimulation from your chest, back, and shoulder trainingâassuming you're hitting them with adequate intensity. Fifteen minutes of arms at the end of these other workouts might be all you need. I'm not asking you to do squats for 15 minutes straight. Even if you're spent from your workout, you should still be able to get in a short arm workoutâunless you're training with Tom Platz's legendary intensity! What you accomplish in 15 minutes depends on you. Maybe you've been beating the hell out of your arms week in, week out for years. If so, this short training might produce new progress. Hell, I've seen people's arms grow from not training them directly at all. So, even after just a quarter of an hour, there's a good chance yours will improve, too. At the very least, I'm confident you won't lose muscle. For many people, the smart play might be to do a short workout rather than no workout at all, just so you won't go backward. Ten years ago, I would sooner have missed a workout altogether than not do my full routine. That was the wrong way to think about it. Something is always better than nothing. Just don't make ""something"" your new standard. I'm not saying you should do this short workout every week for the rest of your life. But if your arm training has grown stale, you're short on time, or your progress has stalled, try this short workout for a week or two straight before going back to more traditional trainingâjust to see if switching it up changes anything. If there seems to be a positive result from adding this workout, do it more oftenâmaybe try three weeks in a row. If you can't do your full arm workout and are thinking about skipping arm day altogether, throw this in at the end of chest or back day, or after you do shoulders. Don't miss arm training altogether just because you can't do it the way you normally would. It's pretty simple. All you need are two movements: one for <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/one-move-for-big-biceps-the-ez-bar-curl.html"">biceps</a> and one for <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/6-best-triceps-workouts-for-men.html"">triceps</a>. Compound movements can work, but you need to be able to work your mind-muscle connection to really focus on your arms. I tend to favor isolation movements because their impact on my whole body is much less than compound free-weight movements, so I'm less likely to slow down from overall fatigue. When 15 minutes is all you've got, you need to maximize time under tension. That means no rest time between sets. None. Begin the first biceps movement using a weight that'll make it a struggle to get 25 reps. Immediately follow it with the triceps movement in the same rep range. As soon as the triceps set is complete, go back to biceps and begin again. Go back and forth over and over again using the same weight, completing as many reps as possible each time. Don't hesitate to incorporate some rest pauses for the sake of getting every last rep you can. If you have a training partner handy, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/when-to-use-intensity-boosters-in-your-workouts.html"">force reps</a> for each other. In short, the goal for those 15 minutes is to go all out! The pump is going to be crazy, fatigue will set in, reps will dropâ¦and that's perfectly normal. Just keep going and complete as many reps as you can on each set. Less time spent training can sometimes yield unexpected results, especially when the weight you use for your 15-minute workout is lighter than normal. In the past, I would have said the best offense is a hard-charging offense. And true as that can sometimes be, at other times you need to pick your battles. If your arm progress is stale, or if you risk missing your arm training altogether, then you have nothing to lose by trying this approach. Give it all you've got for those 15 minutes, and you might just learn something new.",Evan Centopani's 15-Minute Arm Blast
31,"<a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/musclepharm/musclepharm.htm"">MusclePharm</a>-sponsored athlete and Bodybuilding.com spokesmodel finalist Tyler Holt doesn't hold back when it comes to building muscle. ""We all have rough daysâdays we don't want to work out or eat right,"" he explains. ""But if you want the results you're looking for, it needs to be done regardless of how much you don't want to do it. Get it done!"" This back workout is designed to work your back from top to bottom. You'll use max reps, supersets, and even resistance bands to get the job done. ""I think resistance bands are highly underutilizedâbut I love them,"" says Holt. ""Bands are an awesome way to create new tension in the muscle."" Switching up the resistance creates a dynamic tension guaranteed to create a burn in those lats like you've never felt before. This workout should take you 45-60 minutes. Let's get started! ""This first exercise is, in my opinion, the king of back exercises,"" says Holt. Pull-ups are one of the hardest exercises you can do for your back; after all, you're pulling your entire <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/tyler-holts-dual-core-circuit.html"">body weight</a>. Hence its position hereâyou want to do these while your lats are still fresh. In the starting position, where you're hanging from the bar, focus on keeping your shoulders down and back. Maintain that focus as you lift your chest toward the bar. Get a good squeeze in your back at the top of each rep. If you need a little assistance, use a resistance band or use an assist machine. At the bottom, take a page out of Holt's book and stretch those lats out, then contract them before starting the next pull. Doing so enables a full range of motion. Do 4 sets of as many reps as you can complete. You're going to failure, so rest about one minute between sets. Next up is the band resisted dumbbell row. Although you're doing the same number of reps for each of 4 sets, you're trying to increase the weight each time. ""I want you to work,"" says Holt. ""Keep it intense. Push yourself."" The reason you're <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-4-most-important-lessons-every-new-lifter-should-learn.html"">generating more force</a> on this exercise is to emphasize the full contraction at the top of the rep. As you pull against the band, it becomes tighter, generating more force pulling against you. Therefore, the load is heaviest at full contraction, when you're at the top of the rep. ""It's going to be hard,"" warns Holt. ""There's going to be more resistance pulling the weight down and away from you. Regardless, keep working through it."" As with the preceding exercise, you're increasing the weight with each set here. Now, however, you're dropping the reps accordingly, starting with 12 reps, then 10, then 8. The Pendlay row is similar to the bent-over row, with one exception: You start in a deadlift position with the barbell touching the floor. With a regular bent-over row, you can use a lot of momentum from rep to rep. But because the Pendlay row forces you to come to a dead stop on the floor with each rep, you must use your full back to pull up that weight each time. Set up just like a deadlift: straight lower back, hips down, chest and head up. Explode up from that dead-stop position and perform a bent-over row. As Holt explains, this is a total-back exercise. You'll feel your upper back working on the row portion, but since you drop down to the floor on each rep in a deadlift position, your lower back takes some of the brunt, too. Finish off this workout with a heavy/light superset. The objective is to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/screaming-1000-rep-arm-workout.html"">burn out</a> your back completely. On this last exercise pairing, you're really focused on building out your lats. Start with a wide-grip lat pull-down to really build your back width, then segue immediately to a straight-arm cable pull-down. Go heavy on the lat pull-downs to really light up your muscle fibers, but switch to higher reps on the cable pull-downs to pump your lats full of blood. By the end of this workout, you should feel your back top to bottom, left to right. Your back should feel wide, and your muscles will definitely be feeling it for a few days. This is a great workout to throw into your split once a week. If back is the focal point of your training currently, throw it in twice a week. After 6-8 weeks, your back should be noticeably wider and more defined.",Increase Your Back Width With 5 Moves
32,"You're likely aware that the triceps make up a majority of the bulk in your upper arm. As a major contributor to size, training triceps is lesson number one for building bigger arms. Now it's time for lesson number two: The long head of the triceps is the biggest part of the group and adds bulk to your upper arm. Devoting special attention to the long head of the triceps is the key to adding more mass to your arms. The triceps long head is different from the lateral and medial heads because it crosses the shoulder joint and assists in shoulder extension. To best target the triceps long head, therefore, the shoulder needs to be in a flexed position, as in overhead extensions. Overhead extensions won't completely isolate the long head, but they do place the majority of the load on the long head, leaving the other two heads of the triceps playing supporting roles. Do this <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/two-9-minute-arm-workouts-you-can-do-anywhere.html"">quick and effective workout</a> as part of your overall triceps routine, or add it as a secondary workout to your chest or shoulder plan. Just make sure you don't do these exercises at the beginning of your workout. You want your elbows and shoulders already warmed up before you start. To ensure there is an overall balance to your physique and your strength, it's important to make sure each arm works on its own. Therefore, dumbbells are a great choice. It's also a free-weight movement, so your triceps must work even harder to stabilize the weight. With each set, add weight and drop reps, starting with 12 reps on the first set, then 10, then 8. When you perform the overhead extension, lower the weight until you feel a good stretch in your triceps, but avoid going too far, as doing so might cause <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/5-ways-to-train-around-achy-joints.html"">injury</a>. Press the weight up slowly and squeeze with focus at the top. Flex your triceps hard when the weight is all the way up. Keep your arm and shoulder safe from injury by maintaining a slow, steady pace throughout each set. With this exercise, you're still in an overhead position, but now you're working both arms at the same time. Cables keep tension on your triceps throughout the entire rep while also keeping you in a fixed motion, so you can target that long head. Position the pulley at either the bottom or the top of the stack for this exercise. Just choose the position where you feel your triceps working the most. It's tempting to use some body English on this exercise, but avoid that temptation. If you find yourself <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-arm-strategies-doomed-to-fail.html"">using momentum to lift</a> the stack, it means you need to go lighter on the weight. You can't build a muscle if other muscles do the work. Sacrificing your ego by going lighter now will result in greater overall size and confidence later. As with the first exercise, focus on slow, controlled reps. Feel your triceps contract and stretch every time. Since you're using a lighter weight, stick with 3 sets of 15 reps. Do this short finisher workout a couple times a week, and you should notice big growth in your upper arms.",A Short Workout for Your Triceps Long Head
33,"Chest day is always a good investment, but Logan Franklin operates on a philosophy that his tendons and joints shouldn't be taxed for the gains. Franklin's classic physique is honed by an injury-conscious application to classic movements like these four exercises, his standbys for carving well-balanced pecs. Franklin starts with a fly movement to open up his chest, pre-exhausting his pectorals so he doesn't have to go heavy later in the workout. He's looking for longevity in the sport, not <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-shoulder-training-mistake-you-cant-get-away-with.html"">wear and tear on his joints and ligaments</a>. He sits low on the pec-deck machine, allowing his arms to be parallel with his shoulders. He does 2 active warm-up sets, then 4 working sets of 20 reps. He intentionally restricts his range of motion at the back end of the rep to avoid placing excess pressure on his shoulder capsules. After banging out those flyes, Franklin targets his <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/upper-chest-training-made-simple.html"">upper chest</a> next. That's the weaker part of his chest, and the part that he's obsessed with growing. Hence doing the dumbbell presses on an incline bench, which shifts the emphasis to the upper half of the pectorals. Franklin finds that drawing his shoulders back as he presses keeps the emphasis on his pecs while taking it easy on his shoulders. Depending on how strong he's feeling that day, he uses 110-120-pound dumbbells for 4 sets of 15-20 reps. Franklin jumps to the Hammer Strength bench press machine next. He keeps his elbows low, which allows his shoulders to maintain a more neutral position. Again, his positioning is about restricting wear on his <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/save-your-shoulders-the-ultimate-prehab-workout.html"">shoulder girdle</a>, especially because he goes heavy here, starting with three plates on each side and progressing to four. He never goes heavier than that, though. Franklin does 4 sets of 12-15 reps. Franklin does the cable fly for his final exercise, but never does a cable ""cross-over,"" preferring to end his squeeze with matching palms. Again, this avoids extra stress on his shoulder and elbow joints, which may otherwise develop <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/how-bodybuilders-can-avoid-tendon-trouble.html"">tendinitis</a> over time. Longevity is once again the name of the game for him. He does 4 sets of 15-20 reps, at weights his body can handle, focusing on the squeeze at the end of his rep.",Logan Franklin's Joint-Friendly Chest Workout
34,"If you were challenged to build a balanced, massive physique using only eight exercises, which ones would you choose? We posed this conundrum to one of the more relentless athletes we know, MuscleTech-sponsored athlete Lawrence Ballenger. He tends to use a range of movements, making the most of every tool at his disposal to ratchet up intensity and grind out productive workout after workout. But how would Ballenger squeeze nearly the same benefits out of a drastically reduced arsenal? The eight exercises he finally settled on hit every major body part while demanding the most of ancillary muscle groups. His short list provides an effective, efficient, full-body roll call of maximum mass builders that have you gritting your teeth and sucking air whether you're a beginner or have spent years heaving the iron. ""This is the ultimate compound lift, giving you an overall thickness unlike any other exercise,"" he says. ""You can also change your stance to hit different areas of the legs."" For example, a narrow stance (inside shoulder width) focuses on the vastus lateralis on the outer thigh, while a wider stance emphasizes the glutes and the adductors on the inner thigh. No matter which stance you choose, the squat works the stabilizers and also activates your core. ""On top of that,"" Ballenger says, ""it's just one of those basic, primal moves. You get deep, a bit below parallel, and then have to find a way to stand back up. It's you against the weight."" Keep your eyes straight ahead. ""Your head should be straight as you watch your form in the mirror,"" Ballenger instructs. ""Don't look up. Keeping your gaze up toward the ceiling distorts your alignment and potentially can cause lower back and neck problems."" ""The barbell squat is the most productive leg exercise, but the leg press is right up there with it,"" Ballenger says. ""You can change your tempo on this exercise, such as taking 2 seconds on the up and the down with a 1-second pause in the bottom position."" If you have a spotter, he says, you can do dropsets: ""One of my favorite ways to build leg mass on the leg press is to do a combo set, doing 10 reps with one leg, then 10 with the other, and then 20 with both legs."" Don't let your lower back curl off the pad. ""Everyone has a different range of motion,"" Ballenger says. ""Some people who have great hip flexibility can bring their knees all the way into their chest. Don't go this far if you have to curl your lower back away from the pad to do it. Instead, keep working on your flexibility so eventually you can get deeper."" ""Pull-ups hit your lats, of course, but they also work shoulders, biceps, and core stability,"" he says. ""They give you overall thickness and definition that's hard to replicate with any other exercise."" No matter how big you get, he says, keep doing pull-ups. Once you're able to do 2-3 sets of 20 reps, start adding weight with plates or a dumbbell attached to a chain belt, or with a weighted vest. If you struggle with pull-ups, do auxiliary movements such as close-grip lat pull-downs to strengthen the key muscles involved. ""I like the close grip, because it helps me elongate my lats on the stretch, and build up depth through my lats and middle back,"" Ballenger explains. ""I sit upright and bring the handle down to mid-chest level and rotate my shoulder blades on each rep."" If you have a wide waist, he says, blowing out those lats with pull-ups and pull-downs can make your waist appear smaller. ""So much of bodybuilding is creating an optical illusion,"" he says. ""Rowing is key to hit your traps and the middle of your back,"" says Ballenger. ""It gives you thick muscle all along your spine and helps give the body a 3D look. I do bent-over rows all the time. It's one of my staples."" Â As long as you're not dealing with lower-back issues, Ballenger suggests going heavy, starting at 5 sets of 5-8 reps, then pyramiding up to as much as you can handle on the last set. He typically rows 405-475 pounds. Your core should be tight and your back flat. ""Don't let your lower back round when you rep."" Ballenger says. ""Your lats and back are the prime movers, but you need to engage the whole body to stabilize yourself. Walk through that mental checklist before you rep, tensing all the areas you need for support."" Summer's almost here. You don't want to look small in those tank tops, do you? Incline presses focus on the upper chest, and you need that for a great upper body. Ballenger does these heavy, too, for 5 sets of 5 reps. Keep your elbows tucked in close to your torso and control the weight on the way down. Never bounce the bar off your chest. ""Take about 2 seconds to bring the bar down, pause for half a second or so, and then explosively push back up,"" Ballenger says. ""Keeping your elbows in closer to your body keeps tension on the pecs and triceps instead of on your shoulders,"" he explains. ""This gives you a more stable base than when your elbows fan out wide. In general, using wider grips can lead to torn pecs and other chest injuries."" ""Like the incline press, the seated press will give you that powerful upper-body look that pops in a tank,"" says Ballenger. ""These presses emphasize the front and middle delt heads, while also working synergistically with the upper pecs and triceps. Being able to hoist weight overhead is a fundamental component of strength."" You can do this pressâand incline pressesâwith dumbbells instead of a barbell and still get most of the benefits. ""You can handle more weight with a barbell, but the dumbbells mean a stronger side can't overcompensate for a weaker one,"" Ballenger says. ""Why the EZ-bar instead of a barbell? I like the EZ a bit better because it keeps tension off my wrists, and it makes it easier to pin my shoulder blades together and keep my elbows at my sides,"" Ballenger explains. He says he uses a grip inside shoulder width when he wants to work his outer biceps head a little more. He uses a wider grip to work the inner head. Ballenger advises lifters to be sure to move through a full range of motion. ""Many people end up doing half a curl instead of fully elongating their biceps, and that's probably why their arms aren't growing,"" Ballenger points out. ""I'll stop right before my elbow locks outâjust far enough of a bend to maintain tension on the muscle."" ""This is the best triceps exercise out there, in my view,"" Ballenger says. ""I'd suggest approaching these the same as the pull-up: Start by being able to do 2-3 sets of 20 reps. Once you've got that nailed, start adding weight."" Ballenger recommends starting off by using an assisted pull-up machine or running bands under your knees and over the handles to assist you as you come back up. You can also start by practicing negative-only dips, lowering yourself under control, then using your legs to get back to the top. These are three of the easiest ways to get better at dips. Two words:Bottom out. ""You want to get as low as you can in the lower position,"" Ballenger says. ""Over time, that stretch will become easier for you."" Also consider ancillary movements that can improve your dip strength. ""Cable rope press-downs are a good beginner mass gainer,"" he explains. ""When you do these, take 2-3 steps back from the weight stack. Being farther away helps apply constant tension to the muscle."" Here's a sample program that incorporates Ballenger's eight favorite moves across two workouts, which can each be done 1-2 times a week: <strong>Note:</strong> Pyramid up in weight on every exercise, and be sure to include any warm-ups needed, especially on the first 1-2 moves for a particular body part.",The 8 Exercises You Need To Pack On Serious Size
35,"MuscleTech-sponsored athlete Lawrence Ballenger isn't exactly known for mellow workouts. They are harsh! So, when he refers to one of his routines as a ""monster"" workout, consider yourself warned! Lots of sets, lots of reps, a triset, and some nice long negatives make this six-exercise chest torching a thing to rememberâor to try to forget! As you'll notice throughout the video, Ballenger is all about concentration. Before he begins each exercise, he stops to collect his thoughts and focus on the weight and movement to come. Not a bad idea. Get your head in the game, and your body will follow. Keep your feet flat on the ground and drive through your hips. Keep your back arched and your shoulder blades retracted. As with many other lifts, you'll get more from this press by slowly lowering the weight. In this routine, Ballenger wants you to take about 2 seconds to lower the dumbbellsâplenty of time to feel a good burn. Exhale as you push the dumbbells up with your chest. Body position is important with this exercise. Stand erect with your chest out and shoulders back while maintaining the natural curve of your spine. Squeeze those plates together hard! Back to the incline dumbbell press, this time with a neutral grip, meaning palms facing each other. Lock your arms at the top and hold the position for 1-2 seconds, then give yourself a nice, slow negative on this exercise, too. The eccentric part of the exercise should take about twice as long as the concentric. Also known as pec-deck flyes, this exercise presents a great opportunity to generate a massive chest squeeze. Adjust the machine to keep your upper arms parallel to the floor. Push the handles together slowly, then hold the contraction for 1 second when the handles meet. If you don't have access to a pec-deck, exercise bands or cables can simulate the motion. Set the pulleys in a high position for this exercise. Grab the handles and step forward with one leg and bend your torso slightly at the waist. Keep a bend in your elbows as you bring your hands together. Aim for your hands to come together a little bit lower than normal; when they meet, focus on the squeeze. As you move through the concentric portion, achieve a good stretch across your chest.",Lawrence Ballenger's Monster Chest Workout
36,"MusclePharm-sponsored athlete and Bodybuilding.com spokesmodel finalist Tyler Holt isn't afraid to challenge his physical limits. We're talking about the creator of the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/screaming-1000-rep-arm-workout.html"">1,000-rep arm workout</a>, after all! Holt took that same spirit, minus a few hundred reps, and channeled it into this dual-circuit, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink core workout. ""This is a great workout to throw into your routine 1-2 times per week,"" he explains. ""It's not just a bunch of crunches; it's a pretty intense core workout, so a couple times per week should be enough."" This workout gives you a little bit of everything: weighted exercises, timed sets, bodyweight movements, deep core and oblique work, and straight-up six-back burners. After getting though both those circuits, your core should be fried. Let's get started! Toes-to-bar is a classic <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/10-best-muscle-building-ab-exercises.html"">ab-building exercise</a> you can do anywhere you have a pull-up bar. ""My focus on this exercise is tucking my hips forward and crunching my abs to get my feet all the way up,"" explains Holt. If you need to tap your feet on the ground to get yourself stable and ready between reps, go ahead and do that. If you can't get your feet all the way to the bar, just bend your legs and drive your knees up as high as you can. For this exercise, you'll need an incline bench, a cable stack, and a dumbbell. This is a combination of a weighted cable crunch and a dumbbell knee tuck. ""We're using weight at your head and weight at your feet so we can work the entire core from top to bottom,"" Holt says. Using the rope attachment, position the bench below the high pulley and hold the ends of the ropes as you would for a regular cable crunch, hands on either side of your head. Hold the dumbbell between your feet and tuck your knees up while simultaneously crunching forward with the rope so your elbows meet your knees. Pause at the full contraction, then return to the starting position. Position the cable at shoulder height and grasp the handle with both hands, palms facing together and thumbs pointed at the ceiling. Keep your arms mostly straight, and your chest up and back straight as you twist through your torso, rotating your shoulders and pulling the cable with you. ""You want to have a slight bend in the elbow on this exercise,"" explains Holt. ""This keeps tension off the joint."" Keep your hands at the center of your chest throughout the movement so the twist happens at your core and not at your shoulders. Perform all the reps to one side first before switching to the other side. Once you've completed both sides, rest for a minute before repeating the entire circuit again, starting with the toes-to-bar. Complete three total rounds before moving on to the second circuit. ""This second circuit is all timed, all in one space, and uses no extra weightâjust body weight,"" explains Holt. For the V-ups, lie on your back with your arms overhead. You can use a mat if you prefer, or just perform these directly on the floor. From this position, crunch up, trying to touch your hands to your feet at the top of the motion as you lift your upper and lower body into a ""V"" position. Your shoulder blades should come off the ground as you lift your feet until you pretty much balance on your tailbone in the middle. Pause before lowering back down, and try to get <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/3-must-try-interval-workouts-for-summer.html"">as many reps as you can</a> in 30 seconds. For the hip-dips, turn over into a plank position. Rotate the middle of your body so one hip touches the ground, then rotate the other way until the other hip touches the ground. Rotate your feet, too, so your body is actually moving on every rep. ""Even though you're rotating, you still want to keep your elbows still,"" says Holt. ""Don't let them lift up."" Repeat this motion back and forth for the entire 30 seconds. Once you finish the hip-dips, go right into a stationary plank. ""On this exercise, you want to focus on keeping the core tight, so try to suck in your bellybutton to your spine,"" says Holt. ""Don't let your hips sag, and don't let your lower back take over."" Get everything you can out of this exercise by squeezing your core as tight as you can, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-full-body-workout-to-boost-the-big-three-lifts.html"">working every muscle</a> in your core from your rectus abdominis to your obliques. After 30 seconds are up, you get to rest for 1 minute before completing two more rounds of this killer bodyweight circuit.",Tyler Holt's Dual Core Circuit
37,"Keeping it simple is often best. And on chest day, giving your best effort to a few exercises is often way better than trying to tackle lots of movements, but tiring out before reaching the finish. This workout is as bare-bones as it gets, but that doesn't mean it has to be any worse than an eight-move gauntlet. Hit these three moves hard, with the intensity-boosters discussed here, and it can be plenty. Done right, these three exercises will blast every fiber of the pecs from top to bottom and the result will be bigger, stronger, and better pecsâand less wasted time. The incline machine press allows you to focus on the pecs without having to stabilize the weight. If your gym doesn't have an <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-4-best-chest-machines-for-maximum-growth.html"">incline press machine</a>, use a Smith machine with an adjustable incline bench. If you do have access to the incline press machine, then use it. Remember, just because you're using a machine doesn't mean you can't go heavy. Load up the plates and go for 8 reps with heavy weight, maintaining good form the entire time. To keep the tension on your pecs, don't let your elbows lock out at the top. Once you reach failure, rest for 10 seconds and then try to get a few more reps before taking your full 60-second break. Do this for every set. Rest-pause is a great way to add more volume and push your pecs to their absolute limit. Go for 5 sets on this exercise, but if you feel the job is done after 4, move on. Building your shelf is not just about pressing. Flyes improve flexibility, stretch the muscle fibers, and <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/chest-workouts-for-men-the-6-best-routines-for-a-bigger-chest.html"">isolate the pecs</a> without triceps involvement. I don't want to encourage you to go light on this exercise, but keep in mind that flyes are not about using the heaviest dumbbells in your gym. You still want to be able to control the negative on each rep for a four-count. Fighting that resistance as the pecs stretch to lower the weight does much more for you than simply letting the weight drop and trying to jack it back up. Also, don't just clang the weights together at the topâin fact, don't let them touch together at all. Focus on squeezing your pecs and getting a good contraction. You can do this without ever letting the weights touch. Unless your body weight is enough resistance on its own, you'll need to add more weight to your dips to maximize the effectiveness of this <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/lawrence-ballengers-big-fun-arm-blast.html"">great mass-builder</a>. You can either use a weighted vest, a dip belt with plates attached, or chains around your neck. If you opt for the chains, make sure you know what they weigh so you have an idea of how much you're lifting. For this final exercise, you'll switch gears and perform dropsets. Go for as many reps as you can get with the extra weight, and remember, if you can do more than 12 reps, go heavier. Once you reach failure with weight, remove the weight and proceed to failure again. Repeat this dropset for all 3 sets. If you can't do dips with your body weight, use an assistant or a machine and simply add more help after the first failure.",Build Killer Pecs In Just 3 Moves
38,"The abs are much more than a symbol for how lean and muscular you are, they are essential for performance and stability. Abs may be made in the kitchenânutrition is important if you want to see that six-packâbut you still need to train those muscles hard like you would any other group. Abs are a tough muscle group to build because they are already used to doing so much work every day that it takes a lot to overload them. Here are some of the best-kept secrets from old-school bodybuilding legends to build those bricks up to their full potential. Perform this workout with any other muscle group in your split or do your own ""abs day."" As long as you focus and follow this program at least once every week, your efforts will be rewarded when you roll up that T-shirt. This exercise was popular among the legendary bodybuilders of the sport's so-called ""golden era"" to help keep their waistlines trim. But the stomach vacuum is making a comeback among up-and-coming bodybuilders. To perform the stomach vacuum, exhale as much air as possible while drawing in your stomach. Hold this position. Visualize pulling your bellybutton back toward your backbone. If a 20-second hold is too easy, aim for 40-60 seconds. You'll perform a vacuum after every single set of this workout, trying to hold each one for at least 20 seconds. This exercise will get tougher as the workout progresses, but that's the point of an all-out abs workout, so suck it upâpun intended! The key to great abs is to work absolutely every angle of your six-pack, and leg raises are a great way to work the often-neglected lower abdominals. Lie with your back flat on a bench and your legs extended in front of you off the end. Place your hands either under your glutes with your palms down or by your sides holding onto the bench. This will be your starting position. Keeping your legs extended, as straight as possible with your knees slightly bent but locked, raise your legs until they make a 90-degree angle with the floor. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Now, as you inhale, slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position. This is a really fun exercise to do, but one that you need a bit of open space for so you don't accidentally hit someone. This isn't an isolation exercise for any specific area of your core; you'll feel it everywhere! Hold a dumbbell in each hand and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Pull both of the dumbbells to one side next to your hip, rotating your torso as you do so. Keeping your arms straight and the dumbbells parallel to the ground, rotate your torso to <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/ask-the-ripped-dude-whats-an-effective-bodyweight-workout.html"">swing the weights</a> up and over to the opposite side. Pause, then swing the weights up and back to the original side. Continue alternating, rotating from one side to the other until the set is complete. Don't try to impress anyone by using heavy dumbbells on this exercise. The goal here is not to lift as much weight as you can, it's to control the movement using your abdominals while working your midsection in a unique and challenging way. Feel free to use whatever equipment you have on handâfrom a triceps bar to kettlebellsâand rest one minute between sets. For this exercise, go a little heavier if you like, although you must be able to control the weight. If you've never done a press sit-up, try it with no resistance first and practice the movement with your arms up until you feel comfortable. Begin with the barbell resting on your chest on the decline abdominal bench. <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-to-get-six-pack-abs-using-supersets.html"">Tighten your abs</a> as you simultaneously curl up your torso and press the barbell to an overhead position, exhaling through the entire motion. Take your time lowering yourself back to the bench. Each time you press up, do so explosively but under control. If you don't feel comfortable doing this with a barbell, or if you don't have someone to hand you the weight, use a heavy medicine ball or dumbbells instead. Rest one minute between sets. Many people avoid direct oblique work because they think it will expand their waist. But, your obliques should pop as much as your six-pack, and when done correctly, oblique exercises should not widen your waist. You don't have to use a lot of resistance on this exercise to feel your obliques burnâan added perk if you're worried about your taper. Use the high pulley and position the mat on the floor in front of you. Take the rope with both hands and kneel approximately 1-2 feet from the column. Position the rope behind your head with your hands next to your ears. Crunch downward, pulling the weight. As you flex your spine, twist to bring your elbow to the opposite knee. You can either alternate sides or perform all of the reps for one side before switching to the other. Do whichever you find helps you feel it the most. Rest 45 seconds between sets before getting back to work.",Old-School Ways To Build Your Six-Pack
39,"Two-time Ms. Figure Olympia Erin Stern has tremendous shoulders, not only because she trains them hard, but because she trains them frequently. In fact, in her popular Bodybuilding.com All Access program <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/erin-stern-elite-body-4-week-fitness-trainer.html"">Erin Stern's Elite Body 4-Week Fitness Trainer</a>, Stern has you hit them twice a week: once with arms, and once with chest. If you're a woman who hasn't done much dedicated chest training aside from push-ups, get ready to be sore after this workout! Flyes and decline push-ups both put a serious stretch on the chest muscles, which predictably produces DOMS. But that's no reason not to hit it hard and perform each set and rep in this upper-body burner with excellence! Instead of doing agonist-antagonist supersets like you've done in many workouts, today you'll be supersetting body parts that have similar functions. Both the chest and the shoulders move the arm. When you're training either of them, both muscle groups come into play, so supersets are a natural and intelligent choice for training these muscle groups. The pectoralis major is a fan-shaped muscle group that starts along the sternum and clavicle and inserts on the biceps. The pec major is responsible for pulling the arms in like you're giving somebody a hug. Any fly or pressing movement will develop the chest. Start today's workout with a general warm-up. Jumping rope for 5 minutes will prep your entire body and activate your shoulders. If you warm up on the bike or treadmill, mobilize your shoulders with some basic arm circles and movement before lifting heavy. Your warm-up is a great opportunity to focus on the specific exercises you'll do and to think about how you want your body to look and function. Think about how you can push yourself with more weight. Visualize yourself achieving your goals. Keep your back flat against the bench and focus on lifting with your chest. Push evenly with both sides and make sure your wrists are straight. Bring the dumbbells to your shoulders and don't let one arm dip below the other. Your body should be completely upright. Squeeze your glutes, brace your abs, and don't lean forward or back. Bring the dumbbells down to about 90 degrees, pause at the bottom, then press back up for a pause at the top. Your chest should be stronger than your shoulders, so choose a lighter weight for this movement. As you do this lift, picture yourself hugging a barrel and bend slightly at the elbows. Bring your upper arms together at the top and focus on squeezing the chest. Men and women alike need to put more focus on their upper chest. Too much flat benching makes for a lagging upper chest. This is a great exercise to work on your mind-muscle connection. Doing this exercise on a bench eliminates the use of momentum from your trunk. When your chest is against the pad, you have to begin the movement by contracting your shoulders. Bring the dumbbells down to your chest, pause at the bottom, and control the dumbbells with strong wrists to the top. Keep your back straight against the bench. Don't arch too much and focus on pushing with your chest. The incline bench press directly targets your pec fibers. After performing that exercise, standing lateral raises target your side delts. Lateral raises are a perfect exercise to isolate your shoulder caps and work on widening your V-taper. Don't bounce as the reps wear on. You'll be tired, but it's important that you focus on using only your shoulders to move the weight. Your shoulders should swell with blood and burn with lactate. The burn is good! A pump is important for developing great shoulder caps. This finisher will challenge your mental toughness. Keep your core tight and your hips level, and don't let your back arch. The decline adds a little stability work to the push-up and will activate your abdominals as well as your upper pecs. You may feel like quitting after a few reps, but keep going. Think about what this work will do to your physique and strength. It's fine if you can only get 2-3 reps. If you're struggling to get even 1 rep, however, move to regular push-ups. You can even use a band on a bar above for extra assistance!",Build An Elite Upper Body With Erin Stern!
40,"We've all been there: Spring is in full swing and summer's closing in fast, and you've run out of time to launch into a full three-month weight-loss plan to reach your summer-body goals. Lucky for you, there's another way to score that summer six-pack. Simply drop a few quick fat-burning workouts into your current training program, and kick-start your efforts to lean down without drastically changing your routine. We have five fat-blasting programsâcourtesy of <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/bodybuilding.html"">Bodybuilding.com Signature</a> team athletes Julian ""The Quad Guy"" Smith and IFBB bikini pro Taylor Chamberlainâthat take the guesswork out of your summer weight-loss plan. With your choice of glutes and hamstrings, back and core, full-body circuits, arm supersets, and a chest-and-shoulder smackdown, you can mix and match these workouts to fit your weekly split, move some serious weight, and have fun in the process. It's the no-thinking, no-planning, ""grab and go"" workout solution for your leanest summer yet! ""The glutes and hamstrings are often a trouble spot for women,"" Chamberlain explains, ""but guys can benefit from this workout, too."" <strong>Barbell Good Morning/Back Extension:</strong> Keep your spine straight as you hinge from the hips on your barbell good morning, being careful to keep your neck neutral and your shoulders in line. During the back extensions, tuck your chin and round your upper back to help engage your glutes. <strong>Standing Calf Raise:</strong> Aim for a full stretch at the bottom of each rep, holding for a count of one. Maintain this control and avoid bouncing out of the bottom to lift yourself back up. <strong>Barbell Hip Thrust/Single-Leg Hip Thrust:</strong> You may want to prep two barbells for this superset so you can quickly switch to a lighter weight if need be for the single-leg version, which is the same as the regular hip thrust, only with one leg lifted off the ground. <strong>Single-Leg Deadlift:</strong> Keep your non-working leg straight and lift it up and out behind you as you descend. This serves as a counterbalance for your body. Press your body weight back into the heel of your standing leg and keep your hips and shoulders square as you lower down for each repetition. <strong>Smith Machine Reverse Lunge:</strong> The Smith machine version is exactly like the barbell reverse lunge version of this exercise, providing extra stability so you can focus on the action of your legs instead of maintaining your balance. <strong>Wide-Stance Barbell Squat:</strong> Take a full 4 seconds to lower yourself into the squat. Go as deep as you can without letting your heels lift up. Your goal is to get to a point where your thighs are at least parallel to the floor. <strong>Single-Leg Hamstring Curl:</strong> Most leg curl machines have just one long roller to accommodate both feet. For single-leg curls, shift your body slightly on the machine so your ankle is hitting in the center of the footpad. Otherwise, you might put undue stress on your knee. ""The back and core work synergistically, making them a good, dynamic muscle pairing for a high-energy-burn weight-training session,"" explains Smith. ""This workout is front-loaded with four back-focused supersets. Then, you'll switch and do traps and abs in a superset to wrap it up."" <strong>Deadlift/Wide-Grip Pull-Up:</strong> Working down to 4-rep sets is not the norm in fat-burning training, but this workout pushes the pace to increase your anaerobic burn. Rest no more than 1-2 minutes between supersets. You may not be able to handle as much weight by the time you get down to 4 reps as you could had you taken a 3-4 minute rest between sets. However, what you lose in resistance, you'll make up for in total intensity as the training volume builds over the course of the workout. <strong>Wide-Grip Lat Pull-down/Incline Dumbbell Row:</strong> For this superset, strive for a rep cadence of 1:2:1:2, meaning a 1-second negative with a 2-second pause at the starting position, then an explosive 1-second positive and 2-second pause at the fully flexed position. Do this for each exercise, maintaining correct form the entire time. <strong>Barbell Pendlay Row/Straight-Arm Pull-down</strong>: On this superset, change up your rep cadence to 4:2:1:2: a 4-second negative, 2-second pause, explosive 1-second positive contraction, then another full 2-second pause, holding the contraction. <strong>Close-Grip Lat Pull-down/Reverse-Grip Bent-Over Barbell Row:Â </strong>Try to remain upright when doing the close-grip pull-down, pulling the handle down to your upper chest and resisting the urge to lean away or arch your lower back. If you lean back, you'll turn the movement into more of a seated cable row. <strong>Barbell Shrug/Seated Dumbbell Shrug:</strong>Â On this superset, speed up your rep cadence to 1:0:1:2, doing the concentric portion of each rep explosively with no pause before the contraction and a 2-second hold at the top. <strong>Hanging Leg Raise/Decline Crunch:</strong> If you have it in you, you can do an additional seventh superset after this ab pairing, choosing two more core movements such as reverse crunches and crunches, decline twisting crunches and 30-second planks, or V-ups and dragon flags. ""These two circuits will get you moving in multiple directions,"" Chamberlain explains. ""It's not about focusing on one body part, it's about getting everything moving and working together to burn calories while building up strength endurance."" You can tackle the first exercise one of two ways: Either walking forward with each lunge so you move across the floor, alternating legs with each step; or by stepping forward with your right leg, then stepping back to the starting position before stepping forward with your left leg. Next, tackle your burpees head-on with maximum energy, and those 10 reps will fly by in no time.Switch gears to a front squat push pressâalso known as a barbell thrusterâchoosing the weight based on what you can press, not what you can squat. For the bicycle crunch, don't interlace your fingers behind your head and yank on your neck. Instead, rest your hands lightly on the back of your head to help support your head on your neck with your fingertips barely touching each other. If a spin bike isn't available, a traditional stationary or recumbent bike will do. Whichever you use, go all-out for 20 seconds before moving on to the jump squats. If you have trouble getting deep enough on your jump squats, try touching your hands down on the floor between your knees on each rep. For the reverse lunge/biceps curl combo, choose a weight based on what you can handle for the curl. For the plank, don't let your hips sag to the floor as you tire. Continually correct your posture as needed so your body remains straight from head to heels. ""Biceps, triceps, and forearms are smaller body parts, but you can still bump up your metabolism if you're lifting hard and pushing on your rest periods,"" Smith says. ""Keep your rest to 30-60 seconds between supersets and trisets, and don't stop at all within those combos except to change from one move to the other."" <strong>Standing Barbell Curl/Flat-Bench Skullcrusher:</strong> You can trade out a barbell for an EZ-bar or vice versa for either of these movements. Both bars offer a different feel and have slightly different muscle recruitment patterns due to the shift in wrist position. The choice is yours. <strong>W-Bar Triceps Press-down/Seated Alternating Biceps Curl:</strong>Â For this superset, strive for a rep cadence of 1:0:1:2. That's a 1-second negative with no pause at the end, then a 1-second positive and 2-second stop at the fully flexed position. Manipulating cadence stimulates the muscles in new ways, especially if you've fallen into a habit of using the same tempo for all your workouts. <strong>Dumbbell Hammer Curl/Seated Dumbbell Overhead Extension:</strong>Â Change up your rep cadence to 4:0:1:2. Again, the first number is the time you should take on the eccentric in seconds, the second number is what you might consider the starting position (a zero means no pause between reps), the third is the concentric action when you actually do the most work, and the fourth is the peak contraction. <strong>Barbell Wrist Curl/W-Bar Cable Curl/Diamond Push-Up:</strong>Â With these three exercises, you're working from the smallest muscle group to the largest. By the time you hit push-ups, your arms should be screaming for mercy. For a truly excruciating burn, try to finish with a few extra shoulder-width push-ups. These are easier than the diamond version because your chest assumes more of the load. ""Use this in place of your regular chest-and-delt workout if you're in lean-out mode,"" recommends Chamberlain. ""While it's more like a standard muscle-building training routine, you'll rev up the fat-burn a bit when you keep your rest periods under 30 seconds."" For all three pressing movements, increase the weight from set to set so you're failing before 10 reps by the final set. To hit the pectorals in a slightly different way, for the incline dumbbell press use a neutral grip (palms facing one another) versus the usual palms-forward position. Take advantage of what dumbbells offer on the flat bench by going deep in the bottom position for a good stretch. The dumbbells should be alongside your torso at the bottom, at which point your elbows should be fully bent and pointing downward toward the floor. On the front raises, avoid leaning away from the working arm as your shoulders begin to tire. Stagger your feet and keep an upright stance to keep the focus in your front delts. For the lateral raises, keepÂ theÂ first 10 reps heavy by choosing a weight that will result in failure in the 8-10 rep range. Immediately switch to a lighter weightâaround 30 percent lighterâand power through those additional 10 reps. Do this on every set before moving on to the upright rows. By this time your shoulders will be fatigued, so even though it burns, take your time and pause at the top of each upright row to emphasize the contraction.",5 Workouts That Are Insanely Efficient At Torching Fat
41,"If you want to sport a powerful, thick, and full chest, then you have to start at the top. In other words, make your upper pecs the top priority. If you like the volume of this workout by itself, use it as your chest day plan. If you'd prefer to do more work, then start with this workout and add one or two other movements of your choice at the end. Set an adjustable bench to the lowest incline. This will help you focus on the upper pecs and minimize front-delt involvement. When you lower the dumbbells, keep your arms as straight as possible without locking out. Push your chest up as the weights go out to your sides so you can <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-lifters-guide-to-stretching.html"">maximize that pec stretch</a>. Keep your shoulders back so they don't try to join the lifting party. When you lift the weights back up, focus on contracting your chest instead of just lifting the weights. Squeeze your arms together, but don't let the weights touch at the top. Instead, when the weights are above your chest, squeeze your pecs as hard as you can before going back down for your next rep. Once the set is over, rest 45 seconds before your next set. The Smith machine helps you maximize upper-chest recruitment without having to worry about stabilizing the weight, so you can really exaggerate the ""chest up, shoulders back"" form on this exercise. Set your bench to a standard 45-degree angle. As you lower the bar, stop an inch short of touching your chest. Pause. This keeps <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/4-rules-of-chest-specialization.html"">tension</a> on your pecs and keeps momentum at bay. After the pause, press the weight back up and squeeze your pecs at the top. Do not lock out your elbows. If you do, your triceps will take over, which is not what you want. Rest 60 seconds between sets. Push-ups are a basic chest move, but elevating your feet shifts the focus to your upper pecs just like with an incline bench. Place your hands wider than shoulder-width apart to add even more intensity to this movement. Once you <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/beasts-only-chest-workout.html"">reach failure</a> with your feet up on a bench or box, lower your feet to the floor and keep going. Once you reach failure again, your set is over. Rest 30 seconds, then start the next set. You probably won't get as many reps on your later sets, but work hard to make each rep count. If you want a greater range of motion, or have wrist pain when doing push-ups, use dumbbells or push-up handles.",Upper-Chest Training Made Simple

Don't let the simplicity fool you: Your legs will definitely feel it by the end. If you're ready, go crush some legs! A good leg workout begins or ends with a squat, and you'll kick this one off with a traditional back squat, but with a slight variation to put more emphasis on building the front of your legs. Position your feet close together and place your heels on a couple of 25-pound plates. This stance shifts the focus to the outer sweep of the quads, helping you fill out the lines in your lower legs. Before you get into heavy weight on this exercise, make sure you do some <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-do-you-know-when-youve-warmed-up-enough.html"">warm-up</a> sets. Holt recommends lighter weight and higher reps on your first set to get your joints warmed up and your back muscles prepared for the workout ahead. Only after you've completed a proper warm-up should you add more weight. Complete 5 total sets, adding weight and subtracting reps each time. Split squats target the back of the leg, particularly the powerful glute muscles. To maximize your lower-body <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-full-body-workout-to-boost-the-big-three-lifts.html"">athletic power</a>, explode up from the bottom, keeping your head and chest up the entire time. The key to this exercise is to maintain pressure on the heel of your front foot. If you're feeling this move in the quad of the back leg, you're putting too much pressure on your back foot resting on the bench. Shift your weight to your front heel, and make sure you're not leaning forward. You can use any type of weight for this exercise as long as you maintain proper form. ""I choose dumbbells,"" explains Holt, ""but you could also do these with just a barbell on your back."" Any time you perform a single-legged exercise, make sure you start each set with the same leg so both legs get the same amount of rest on each round. Complete 3 sets of 12 reps on each leg. Dead rest leg pressâin which you come to a complete stop at the bottom of every repâbuilds power and strength. According to Holt, this exercise is easier if you have a pin-loaded leg press. If you don't have access to this kind of press, you can do this exercise on a regular leg press and just pause at the bottom. You already have a couple of other exercises under your belt, so it's time to up your game and do 3 heavy sets of only 8 reps each. The objective is to build power and strength. By going heavy and using the dead rest method, you're going to generate significantly more leg power. You can also use this exercise to build size. All you need to do is switch up the position of your feet. ""If you want to put more emphasis on the quads, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/where-should-i-place-my-feet-on-the-leg-press.html"">position your feet</a> a little lower and close together,"" Holt explains. ""If you want to emphasize your hamstrings, place your feet higher and a little wider."" The seated leg curl is an <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/10-best-muscle-building-isolation-exercises.html"">isolation movement</a>, so make sure at the end of each rep you get a good squeeze in the hamstrings to emphasize your mind-muscle connection and prevent any other muscle from taking over the movement. If you prefer, you can do lying leg curls instead. Just remember to increase the weight on each set as you drop those reps. Just as you did with leg <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/screaming-1000-rep-arm-workout.html"">curls</a>, add weight and drop reps on each set of these extensions. This is another isolation movement, so once again you'll want to focus on that quad squeeze at the top of each rep. By the end of this workout, every muscle in your legsâglutes, hamstrings, quadsâshould feel like it got run through the washing machine on the heavy-duty cycle. The entire workout will take you 45-60 minutes. Work it into your split any time you need to hit your legs hard!",Minimalist Muscle-Building Leg Workout
43,"How many times have you decided to just skip the gym because 10 minutes just isn't enough time to get a decent workout in? After all, 10 minutes isn't a lot of timeâonly 600 seconds! While you shouldn't depend on short workouts to meet your long-term goals, quick sessions do have their place in your training routine for a couple of reasons. First, if 10 minutes is all you have, 10 still beats 0 every time. Second, you can use short workouts as a second session to bring up a weak body part, and for many lifters the back could always use some extra attention. Due to the short amount of time you have for this workout, you must keep rest to an absolute minimum. Treat this workout as one giant set to help you do as much work as possible in the least amount of time. This means you'll do all of the exercises back to back without stopping before taking a rest. To cut down on transition time between movements, make sure your exercises are all set up close together. You don't want to waste time moving from one end of the gym to the other. Take a 60-second rest between sets, and perform at least two giant setsâthree if time permits. The <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-beasts-only-back-workout.html"">T-bar row</a>Â is a great back blaster and simple to execute. The wide grip targets the lats, while the bent-over position works your lower back and core. This move is easier to do if you have a T-bar station, but if not, a bar and landmine setup with a handle works just as well. Don't be afraid to go heavy, but keep in mind you do have three other exercises to do with no rest between. Some people use straps on this exercise, but I would recommend leaving them in the gym bag and instead choosing a weight that is challenging but doable without straps. Dumbbells are great for quick workouts like this because you can set them anywhere to keep your exercises close to one another. Grab the pair you'll need for the row and keep them right next to the T-bar station. As soon as you finish with the first movement, grab the weights and get to work. Using dumbbells instead of a barbell allows you to get a greater <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/mobile-muscle-your-active-mobility-plan-increased-rom-strength.html"">range of motion</a> and target the mid-back muscles closer to the spine. Maintain a tight core and a strong neutral spine to protect your lower back. Rest your upper chest on an incline bench if your core needs a break. For this exercise, you'll have to move to a lat pull-down machine. Fortunately, the last two exercises are in the same spot so you won't have to move again. Even though the time is ticking on this quick workout, avoid using momentum on your pull-down. Make your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-5-best-back-machines-for-maximum-growth.html"">lats</a> do the work. It's best to lower the weight when necessary to feel the muscles in the back working. Squeeze your elbows in at the bottom of the exercise to get a good contraction before letting the handle back up. As soon as you finish the last rep, switch the grip for your final exercise. Even though it's the same station, reversing your grip for this final exercise targets the back from a different angle. Not only can you effectively hit the lower lats with a reverse grip, but this position also allows the biceps to assist the lats in finishing up on this final exercise. Remember to keep your chest up and not to jerk the handle, even though your muscles will be tired after all those reps. The key to a good pull-down is to maintain as much of a vertical base as possible. Once you finish your reps, take a quick break and start the <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/7-moves-that-are-better-together.html"">circuit</a> over again, trying to get in at least one more full round. For an extra intensity boost, try setting a timer to see how quickly you can do three rounds. Then, try to beat that time the next time you do this workout.",Blast Your Back In 10 Minutes
44,"Like all seasoned lifters, MuscleTech-sponsored athlete and Team Bodybuilding.com athlete Abel Albonetti knows that what goes on in the gym is only part of getting your gains. ""You go to the gym, you tear down muscle, and then you take care of your nutrition,"" he says. ""That's how you rebuild muscle to make your pecs bigger."" Having said that, Albonetti does everything he can to make his workout feel twice as hard as it should. Must be all those inclines, dropsets, and supersets. He starts this killer workout with some bitchin' benches, and he doesn't let up. Albonetti starts this workout heavyâvery heavy. He uses a medium-width grip. Aim for a weight you can use to do 2-4 clean reps. Give your body a minute to recover after each set, then go back and hit it heavy again. Lighten up the weight for these presses because your reps increase to 10-12. Get your first 4 sets in, then make the fifth set your double dropset. Here's how: Do as many reps as you can with the weight you've been using. Once you hit failure, drop the weight about 25 percent, go to failure, then drop it another 25 percent and go to failure. You're now 25 percent through the workout, but it probably feels like you're finished. Do this press one arm at a time. Keep one arm extended as you do 10 reps with the other arm, then switch sides. As you lower the weight, focus on giving that arm a good stretch before pushing again. Meanwhile, keep tension on the pec on the opposite side of your chestâthe pec that's holding your extended arm in place. Keep tension in that arm for all 10 reps as you let that other arm go down, stretch, then press up. Albonetti does his incline bench presses using a back-row machine, which lets him get his hands very close together to work his pecs a little harder. If you have access to this machine, squeeze that bar as hard as you can and lift straight up. If you don't, do incline bench presses or, if it's available, use a landmine. If you use a barbell, place your hands shoulder-width apart. If you use a landmine, squeeze hard to work those pecs. When you finish each set of bench presses, proceed immediately to the incline flyes. This giant set is all about failureâin a good way. Take cable cross-overs to failure, then immediately switch to standing chest presses and do them to failure as well. Again, without hesitation, elevate your feet up on a bench and do push-ups to failure. That's one giant set. After your last push-up, rest 45 seconds. Then, do another giant set. Continue alternating giants sets and 45 seconds of rest until you have completed a total of 7 giant sets. If you can get your body up off the floor for that seventh set of push-ups, you're a badass. Do this workout once a week to build that thick, broad chest that'll have you visiting the specialty shirt shop before you know it.

45,"Like a modern-day Sisyphus, Tony Sentmanat drags a 150-pound sled up and down the block-long parking lot that runs in front of a strip mall stretched along Highway 157 in Arlington, Texas. This Marine Corps vet, former SWAT operator, combat trainer, and marksman is here to train with IFBB pro bodybuilder and repeat Arnold Classic winner <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/podcast-episode-36-larger-than-life-lifting-and-eating-with-branch-warren.html"">Branch Warren</a>. Warren, known as the ""Texas Rattlesnake,"" is here to work on his functional strength, agility, and mobility after a long career making the iron go up and down. Taking turns, Warren and Sentmanat drag the sled about 30 yards in each directionâpast the pawn shop, around the potholes, and close enough to the faded blue dumpster to catch a whiff of the oil-soaked car-part boxes baking in the sun. When they're done with that, they farmer's-walk the same distance with a hex bar loaded with 360 pounds of iron. From there, they take a 10-pound sledgehammer to a giant truck tire. All this insane action takes place at the end of a grueling leg day inside Metroflex Gym. ""We're doing this mostly for Branch's sakeâto get moving, to get more functional,"" Sentmanat says. ""As Branch gets up in age [he's 43], he wants to be able to move around better. That's also why he's lost a bit of weight and gotten leaner. So, we decided to go outside after our inside workout and see how much we had left."" The workout totals only six exercises, but it's enough to destroy lesser men. These behemoths do the whole thing crazy-heavy, piling on the 45s like pancakes at a firehouse fundraiser. And when they're on the machine, they use up every pin hole on the stack. Like they say: ""There's no magic pill. Bring the pain."" Push yourself to the limit. This calls for 6-8 reps. Make sure you earn every one. The last one should burn you out every time. If you go heavy, grab a partner so you can spot each other. These guys start with four 45-pounders on each side of the apparatus, then work up to a total of 22 platesâ990 pounds, plus the weight of the press itself. Then they do 4 setsâ¦of 20, and Branch reps out 30 times in his last set! This time, they go from 8 plates to 12 plates to 14 plates per side, and they go deep and fast. Don't cheat on these by barely bending your knees. You're on a machine, but it's still a squat. At the bottom, your thighs should at least be parallel to the floor. After a leg-day workout that would make any mere mortal wobble, the dynamic duo heads outside to burn whatever's left in their tank. They'll drag the sled and carry the hex bar for a total of 60 yards per set for 4 setsâand they don't dawdle. Pull the sled at a run, do the farmer's walk as fast and heavy as you can, and slam the sledgehammer down hard AF, as if the tire just insulted your mother. Job done.

46,"The late Vince Gironda, affectionately known as ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtBGZ-aa6Xg"" target=""_blank"">The Iron Guru</a>,"" developed approaches to hypertrophy that are still being used 60-plus years after he developed them. In an era that stretched from the 1940s to the 1990s, Gironda was well known as a professional bodybuilder, author, and owner of Vince's Gym on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, California. He covered a lot of territory in his life, espousing many unorthodox training and nutritional ideas that seemed to fit his colorful personality. Athletes who trained at Gironda's famed gym included Franco Columbu, Dave Draper, Clint Eastwood, Frank Zane, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Larry Scott, and Lou Ferrigno. It is not overstatement to say that Gironda, who died in 1997, helped influence the training philosophy of the bodybuilding world's equivalent of Mt. Rushmore. Â  His 8x8 system continues to be one of the most unorthodoxâand most challengingâapproaches out there. If you're ready for some serious hypertrophyâalong with fat lossâprepare yourself for 4-6 weeks of hell. Gironda referred to his 8x8 system as ""honest"" because you're going to be doing an honest day's work in the gym: 8 sets of 8 reps with just a 30-second break between sets. This workout has been known to bring trainees to their kneesâeven when they're using pygmy weightsâbecause of this man's ruthlessly effective system. The 8x8 has been used for various body-part splits. The most impressive results have come from doing full-body routines 2-3 times a week for 4-6 weeks. For best results, mix compound movements with single-joint movements, starting your weights at approximately 40-50 percent of your one-repetition maximum, then moving upâor downâas required to challenge yourself while maintaining strict form. If you have good muscle endurance, you may be able to use more weight. Your goal is to finish all 8 sets. If you run out of gas toward the end, reduce the weight so that you can consistently hit all 8 reps of all 8 setsâwithout taking more than 30 seconds between setsâand while maintaining form! To vary the stimulation and provide for more growth, both physiologically and psychologically, switch up your routine from time to time using these alternate exercises: Be prepared for your heart rate to be accelerated for the entire workout. If you haven't done much high-volume training, and you've figured out your nutrition, this workout can ignite some serious muscle hypertrophy. The 8x8 is interval training ""on steroids,"" and it will ramp up your metabolism to help you achieve incredible fat-loss benefits. With any kind of training, it helps to know what you are hoping to achieve. Here, the objective is to get a skin-splitting pump while increasing your level of conditioning. The goal is to lift as much weight as possible within the given parameters. As you work your way through the routine, you should be able to increase your conditioning and the amount of weight you use. As soon as 50 percent of your max becomes routine, bump it up to 65 percent! At the same time, be prepared to lower the weight if needed; it won't be the end of the world. With Gironda's routine, technical failure is failure. Use whatever weight helps you execute safely and with great form. Vince was a stickler when it came to proper form, so you need to be one tooâfor your own protection. There are a number of exercises you should avoid while using the 8x8 system. This is not to say you should avoid them completelyâjust in this context. <strong>Front squat</strong>: This is a great exercise for a high-intensity, lower-volume phase. Here, though, volume is king, and your rhomboids will fatigue isometrically long before your thighs. <strong>Grip-limiting exercises:</strong> On any exercise, if grip limits you, wear straps. If you do not have straps, avoid the exercise unless your objective is targeting forearms, grip, or both. <strong>Cumbersome exercises:</strong> Any exercise that is a pain in the ass to set up (e.g., heavy dumbbell presses or walking-out squats) is a no-go. <strong>Technically complex lifts</strong>: Exercises such as Olympic lifts are 100-percent out! Anything technically complex raises the risk of injury and decreases the work of the targeted muscle. <strong>Deadlifts, bent-over rows, good mornings</strong>: These are awesome exercises, but doing them when fatigued increases the risk for lower-back injuries.","8x8: An Honest Workout By The Late, Great Vince Gironda"
47,"There's a saying that has been shared in sports for several years now: If you want to win championships, you have to do champion shâwell, you get where I'm going with this. Put simply, if you want serious results, you have to do serious work. To get big arms, you'd better be ready to push yourself to new levels of intensity. This beasts-only arm workout is going to hurtâbut time spent talking is time wasted. Let's get to work! Choose whichever exercise will work best for you based on preference or the equipment you have available. This is a 5-minute AMRAP, so take that into consideration when choosing your bar, especially since you'll be loading a weight that you'd normally do for no more than 10 reps. Hey, I told you this workout is a beast! Set a timer or watch a clock. Once you start, you have 5 minutes to get as many reps as you possible can. <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/when-to-use-intensity-boosters-in-your-workouts.html"">Curl to failure</a>, rest for a few seconds, then go again. When you resume, pick up the count where you left off. You want to go all out during your working interval, so set the bar down and rest completely when you need it, but only so you can pick that bar right back up a few seconds later. Don't even think about a target rep range. Just go. When that 5 minutes is up, rest for 2 minutes. What you just did for the curls is what you will do again here. If you have elbow issues, make sure your elbows are warmed up before you start, or choose another movement, like close-grip bench or dips instead. Just make sure to pick a movement you can do for the full 5 minutesâthe goal is growth, not <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-shoulder-training-mistake-you-cant-get-away-with.html"">injury</a>! Once again, choose a heavy weight you can only do for about 10 reps before failure. Then, just start your clock and go, <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/beasts-only-chest-workout.html"">unleashing that beast</a> within you to dominate the bar. After your 5 minutes are up, rest for a solid 2 minutes. Next, you'll knock out a superset with dumbbells, forcing each arm to work independently. If you prefer to save time on the curls, you can work both arms at once rather than alternating. As soon as you finish your first set of curls, hit the floor and go straight into floor presses. Hold the dumbbells in a <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-back-workout-youll-feel-till-next-week.html"">neutral</a> or hammer grip, letting your elbows stop on the floor to keep the emphasis on the triceps. Take 2 minutes to rest between supersets, and complete 4 total rounds. Giant arms require giant sets, and with this onslaught of heavy cable-focused arm exercises, you'll be busting those shirt sleeves in no time! You'll basically live at the cable station for this giant set. Pick the handle you like best because you'll use it for all four exercises. If you have any doubts, just use the rope. Set the pulley to the bottom and lie on the floor to perform the first set of curls. After 10-12 reps, stand up and do 10-12 standing curls. Now, move your attachment up top. Face away for the overhead triceps extensions, then spin back around and finish the set with your basic triceps press-downs. Complete 4 giant sets just like that, taking only 90 seconds of rest in between. Once you finish this monster set, you'll have an <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/1-month-to-big-arms.html"">arm pump</a> like nothing you've ever felt before.",Beasts-Only Arm Workout
48,"As crazy as it might sound, you can get a great upper-body workout in only 15 minutes if you do the right exercises and use the right approach. The key is circuits, which allow you to handle a lot of volume in a short amount of time. The benefits extend beyond efficiency, however. Circuits challenge your fitness level in a way that traditional straight sets simply can't. They also eliminate the excuse that you don't have enough time to trainâbecause anyone can find 15 minutes to spare! This circuit is designed to keep you close to your incline bench. That way, you don't have to move from one end of the gym to another for each exercise, and you don't have to worry that someone might take your weights. Creating circuits like this that you can do in a small area helps save a ton of time. Your transition between exercises is quick, and others can see you're working in that space so they are less likely to accidentally take your equipment. For this circuit, you'll warm up first, then aim for two full rounds, resting only 1 minute between. Remember, you want as little rest as possible between exercises. So mentally prepare yourself to hustle. If your 15 minutes is not yet up after the second round, you can start a thirdâbut stop if you must when your time is up. There isn't too much to say about the incline press that hasn't been said before. It's your basic, compound pec-punisher, which is precisely why it has a place in this fast-and-furious chest routine. Set the bar up with a weight you can handle for around 10 reps. You don't want to reach failure right out of the gate, but you still want something challenging. If you're dying to do something different, try 1-1/2 reps on your press. To do this, perform a full rep, then lower the bar halfway down and press back up. That's 1 rep. Those half reps might not feel like much at first, but eventually your pecs will be struggling to hold the bar and press it back up. Repeat these <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/essential-8-exercises-to-get-ripped.html"">1-1/2 reps</a> for the full set. This exercise may look easy, but don't try to do it with 45s. As a matter of fact, if you're new to the Svend press, start with 2-1/2-pound plates until you feel it working properly. Then work up to 5s and maybe 10s. This exercise is really not about the weight at all; it's about squeezing your arms together and <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-chest-workout-youll-feel-till-next-week.html"">contracting the pecs</a> as you press your hands forward. When done correctly, you'll feel this work from the outer pecs all the way into the middle. Your chest won't be the only muscle group working on this exercise; your core is going to have to keep your body stable. But, if you have a strong core and you're up for a total-body chest exercise, this one move will annihilate your pecs. If you have dumbbells that allow the plates to spin, you can use those instead of the barbells. If not, the regular version is probably your best bet. You can also <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-to-dial-in-the-crucial-details-of-your-physique.html"">get creative</a> and use a couple of towels on a smooth floor, or Frisbees if you're on carpet. This is a tough exercise but well worth it if you manage to keep the tension on the pecs. If you're in a smaller gym that doesn't have a lot of floor space, go with a <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/suspended-chest-fly"">suspended fly</a> or place a band around a solid object. Perform a traditional push-up, then rotate your body to the right in a clockwise direction using your hips as the pivot point. Perform another push-up, and rotate again. If you start at what would be the 12 on a clock, the next position would be 1, then 2, and so on until you make your way all the way around and end up facing the same direction as you started. For an added challenge, ""hop"" your body into position each time. On the second round, go in a counter-clockwise direction, rotating to the left instead of to the right on each repetition.",Time Crunched? Try This 15-Minute Chest Circuit
49,"It's understandable that you'd watch a video like Abel Albonetti's high-volume back workout and try to keep up rep for rep, set for set, and pound for pound. If you've been lifting for as long as he hasâ12 years and countingâand know your strength and endurance limits, then maybe you can. But, as Albonetti points out at the start of this video, ""I've been pushing my body to the limit for years, but if you're fresh at the gym don't come in here and do my exact workout. You will end up hurting yourself."" Instead, he says, ease into it. If he calls for 5 sets of an exercise, start with 2 or 3 sets, see how it feels, then increase or decrease the sets until you feel challengedânot obliterated. You might wonder if you can still build muscle if you're doing less volume than he is. ""You're going to see the same benefits,"" Albonetti says, ""because your body isn't as used to working out."" Experienced lifters fondly remember when they first started weight training and it was so easy to add muscle. The longer you lift, the harder it is to do it. No matter how long you've been at it, this workout from Abel Albonetti is going to soak your shirt and put your teeth on edgeâbut that's what you're after, right? So dig into it and enjoy the ride. As Albonetti says, customize each exercise to your ability level. ""There's no need for you to do five sets of something and really just burn yourself out when you could grow by doing only 3 sets,"" he says. For this first exercise, he does 5 regular sets, then one triple dropset: 6 reps at the weight he used for the first 5 sets, then 6 more reps at a lighter weight, and another 6 at a still lighter weight. For hand placement, Albonetti says to put them wherever it feels like they help engage your lats the most. He tends to put his hands closer together than what many people would consider a wide-grip position. Start with 4 normal sets, then move into another triple dropset. If you're new to the gym, don't push your limits on weight. Notice when Albonetti does these, there's a little sway in his back when he come up, but he is very careful not to bend his lower back. This exercise is normally done with barbells, but it works perfectly well with dumbbells, too. Whatever you use, take it slow and keep your back straight and parallel to the floor as you row. At the bottom of very rep, reset by putting the weight on the floor for half a second before pulling it straight up again. This short break removes the momentum from the rep and forces you to do a little more work. The one-arm cable pull provides an opportunity to work on the mind-muscle connection. Doing this exercise one arm at a time enables you to really pay attention to the muscle as it moves from contraction to lengthening with each rep. Abel further emphasizes the feel of the movement by adding a slight rotation at the back of each rep. Finish each set of rows, then move directly to the pull-downs, emphasizing a lat stretch at the top of the movement and controlling the movement on the way down. Albonetti calls out 4 sets of 12 reps, but he tends to go to failure. As you can see in the video, when his arms and back get torched, he pulls hard on the cable and leans way back to give himself a rest-pause under tension before trying to gut it out for a couple more reps. Just remember that he's been doing this for more than a decade and has trained himself to work this hard. If you're new to the game, don't overdo it. He uses a V-grip for both his cable rows and his pull-downs instead of the usual bar. Albonetti ends the workout by being a nice guy and doing just a single dropset of lat pull-downs, instead of the triples he's been doing throughout the workout. Reduce the weight just one time, go to failure, and you're done!
