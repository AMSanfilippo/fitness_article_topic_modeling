0,"The first part of this workout by Sarah Hunsberger is all about lifting with intention. You'll be doing nine upper-body exercises in the 8-12 rep range, all the while using the mind-muscle connection to help you focus. As you move through each exercise's range of motion, pay attention to your body to make sure you're using the right muscles for each move. Once you've finished shoulders, Hunsberger will take you through a three-part ab workout on the Swiss ball, continuing to use the mind-muscle connection. Add it all up for 12 moves total. As you go through this workout, follow Hunsberger's lead and move slowly through each exercise, focus on the target muscles, and get that nice torched feeling from waist to shoulders!",12-Move Upper-Body Workout For Women
1,"Look around online and you'll find lots of ""arm workouts for women."" Most of them feature perky young lassies doing hundreds of reps with 3-pound pink weights while dancing the merengue, doing jumping jacks, or basically just standing there posing. This is not that kind of workout. This one will kick your ass, and it'll do it in about a half an hour. Team Bodybuilding.com-sponsored athlete <a href=""https://bodyspace.bodybuilding.com/courtgard"">Courtney Gardner</a>'s workout is intense, with sets in the 10-rep range, short rest periods, a superset, and a double dropset. Your arms will be torched and your heart thumping as you burn through these six relentless exercises. The goal of this exercise is to target the biceps, so keep your elbows tight against your sides so you don't recruit chest or shoulder muscles. This should be all biceps, all the time. Just one slight modification to this classic curl will make your arms freak out. The single-arm hold will increase time under tension, since you're resisting weight even in your ""resting"" arm. As the reps unfold, you'll be tempted to let that resting dumbbell drop. Rather than giving in, do your best to hold your ""non-working"" arm steady at 90 degrees. This is one of the best triceps exercises. To reap the full benefit, keep your elbows in and squeeze your triceps at the top. Engage your core throughout each set. Keep your hands next to your hips on the bench to avoid putting extra tension on your shoulders. Your feet can go on the floor or up on another bench. In all the arm exercises you've done in this workout so far, you've used a supinated (wrists turned up) grip. Switch here to a neutral grip, with your hands perpendicular to your body and facing each other. Switching grips enables you to target the same muscle at different angles. End this short workout with a total burnout sequence. Do 10 reps, drop the weight and, with no rest, do 10 more reps. Drop the weight again and go directly into 10 more reps. This is the last exercise of the workout, so keep going and finish strongâeven when you feel like you've got wet cement in your veins and your arms are going to fall off.",30-Minute Kick-Ass Arm Workout

Get in some cardio with Jessie's <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jessie-hilgenbergs-power-plyo-circuit-workout"">power plyo workout</a>. Not only will you develop explosive power, but you'll also take your leg training to the next level. You're going to kick off this workout with a Smith machine triset of squats, lunges, and rows. This trifecta will target your quads, hamstrings, and glutes, while hitting your upper body in the back, biceps, and traps. Then, you'll do a few more total-body movements for good measure.  This variation is only slightly different from the standard squat, but the difference is one you'll definitely feel. After you press out of the hole, pause for a moment halfway up. Then, squat all the way back down, maintaining a flat back and keeping the weight in your heels. Then, come all the way back up to your starting position. All of that equals one rep. This added time under tension means you might want to start out with a slightly lighter weight.  Think of these as a horizontal barbell pull-up. Strengthen your middle back while improving your grip strength, and even getting in some arm training.  Use a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, and keep your body straight, with your heels on the ground, throughout the movement. Retract your shoulder blades as you pull your chest toward the bar, and pause momentarily at the top of the movement before lowering yourself down.  Hit your quads hard with this lower-body exercise and also target the calves, glutes, and hamstrings. Make sure to keep your body upright, hips tilted forward, and head up throughout the movement.  Make sure you're stepping back far enough that your knee doesn't surpass your toes on your leading leg, but instead forms a right angle. Perform all your reps for one leg before switching to the other.  Strengthen your middle back, posture, and your overall upper-body pulling strength with this classic bodybuilding movement.  The key here is control. Hinge at the waist, and keep your back straight at around a 45-degree angle throughout the set. Pause at the top, contract your back muscles, and slowly lower the weight under control.  Time for some abs! You'll especially target your lower abs here, but make no mistake, your entire core will get worked with each rep. Looking to lighten the challenge? Make this exercise easier by decreasing the decline on the bench.  This deceivingly simple move targets your posterior deltoids and middle and upper back, while improving posture and shoulder balance. Your core will get a surprising amount of work as well, even at a light weight. Use a neutral grip, squeeze at the top of the movement, and return in a slow and controlled manner.

6,"Finding the right workout partner is almost as difficult as finding a spouse, but hooking up with the right one can pay big dividends. Among them, support, accountability, and motivation are often cited. You can even create a healthy sense of competition that pushes you just a little more. In the weight room, I find that I'm often able to complete heavier sets or do more reps than I'd otherwise be able to do on my own. Besides being a spotter and cheerleader on heavy sets, a partner can watch your form and provide feedback, especially as you fatigue. I also find I'm less likely to blow off cardio sessions when someone is waiting for me. Is there a quantifiable benefit? A study in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine sought to determine the training effects of a workout partner on cardio work and whether it could appreciably improve results.[1] In the study, 58 women were divided into the following groups that exercised on a stationary bike at a given percentage of their heart rate (65 percent of heart-rate reserve) for time on six separate occasions: One group exercised by themselves. One group exercised with an onscreen partner via virtual link but independently from them. One group exercised with an onscreen partner, but the ""partner"" was in fact a taped loop, so the partner was always better than the subject. The subject was also told the performance would be judged by whichever partner stopped exercising first, essentially motivating the subject to train longer. g-stockstudio/Shutterstock The results showed that solo riders lasted on average 10.6 minutes before stopping. The group that trained with independently working partners averaged 19.77 minutes, and the group that trained with a teammate motivated by not wanting to be the low score trained the longest at 21.89 minutes. The third group, in fact, was on their bikes more than double the amount of time than the cyclers who did it alone. It should be noted that significantly increasing workout length like this can lead to major fitness gains over time, especially during aerobic-type training. (Be aware that pushing your body too far too often can be counterproductive in terms of muscle strength and hypertrophy.) Working with a partner in either a friendly or competitive way can allow you to achieve better and faster results during cardio training, and you may be able to reap additional gains with someone who is in better physical condition than you are as you try and keep up with them.",Double Your Cardio Performance With A Workout Partner
7,"We've all probably done a plank or two before, right? Whether you're aiming for a 1-minute hold or challenging yourself in the fully elevated position, a static plank can get a bit dull after a while. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of planks—and their modifications. These exercises are incredibly effective for overall core strength and can help to improve your posture. As a bonus, they can work your entire body, depending on what type of plank you do. This all sounds a lot more fun than just a static hold, doesn't it?  I love to switch things up with my workouts. I often take the most basic version of an exercise—in this example, a plank—and then add another element. Doing so provides a fun new challenge, keeps my body guessing, and expands my exercise repertoire.  Before you try these variations, a note of caution: Make sure you have your form down on both elbow and fully extended planks first. You want to feel confident with those moves before kicking things up a notch. I love adding this exercise in as a cardio burst between sets when I'm strength training. It's especially good for an extra challenge on an upper-body day. Not only does this movement elevate your heart rate, it also works your chest, shoulders, back, and triceps (along with your core, of course).  <strong>Tip:</strong> Your hips shouldn't rotate when you're moving up and down. The key is to keep your glutes tight and maintain a neutral spine throughout the motion, even though you're going from hands to elbows. Your upper body should be the only thing making swift movements. Ah, the plank jack—such a fun hybrid of planks and those jumping jacks I despised having to do back in my PE class during junior high. Should be fun, right? You're getting a cardio burst workout while working your lower body (think glutes firing on each movement). You're also engaging your chest, shoulders, back, triceps, and many stabilizer muscles with every single rep. There are a few ways to do these, and honestly, they pretty much come down to personal preference, pre-existing injuries, and just how high-impact you'd like to make the ""jack"" motion of your plank. Adding these in toward the end of an upper-body workout (between sets of chest or shoulder exercises especially) serves as an extra challenge and bonus burnout exercise for upper body. <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep your upper body stationary the entire time. Don't jump out with your arms as you do with your legs. Looking to make plank jacks even more challenging? Add a loop band right above or below your knees. This will challenge your glutes and stabilizer muscles even more! These are one of my absolute favorite <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/finder/lookup/filter/equipment/id/5/equipment/body-only"">bodyweight exercises</a>! I love this combo so much that I'll even add it on days I'm at the gym, not just for workouts on the go. We all know how awesome push-ups are for overall strength, so combine a push-up with a side-plank rotation to work your entire body. I like to start with this combo on days I train chest, so I do this before I've fatigued my upper body with serious weight training.  You're literally getting in a total-body workout with this push-up to side-plank rotation combo. Your core is engaged, all of your upper body is working with each push-up, and your lower body is engaged even more when you're in that side-plank position. As a bonus, your heart rate will be more elevated during these movements than it would be in just a static plank.  <strong>Tip:</strong> If this combo sounds too crazy, begin from a modified push-up position on your knees. You can still perform a modified side-plank rotation from the knee position. Build your strength and coordination here, then work up to one, two, and three sets of the full push-ups to side-plank rotations. Here's another way to turn your plank into a total-body workout. I love to incorporate these into my core training for a great ab and lower-back workout. You'll improve your strength, balance, and coordination as you alternate extending one arm and one leg at the same time. Just remember to use opposite sides, or you may find balancing even more complicated. <strong>Tip:</strong> If you're new to this, begin in the elevated-plank position. Extend your left arm first, then lower it before extending your back right leg and lowering it. I often superset this exercise with a set of reverse crunches on a decline bench. I use it at the end of a workout when I'm concentrating on abs, or add it to an at-home yoga day. Side planks are another fun challenge. You can perform these on your elbows or fully extended. As with the other plank variations, you'll be challenging your core but placing an extra emphasis on your obliques as you push through your elbow/forearm or the palm of your hand from the elevated position. Aside from serving as a challenge to your core, back, and obliques, this move works your glutes and inner thigh muscles. Win-win! I would not typically include all the planks listed above in one workout, as I think that would be a bit of a plank-palooza. Instead, here's a fun way to do a HIIT-style bodyweight workout at home while incorporating a few of the plank variations.  Perform one set of each exercise back-to-back for 30 seconds. Rest briefly (30-60 seconds) after completing one full round of the HIIT circuit below. Then repeat the circuit until you've completed 3-5 rounds.

8,"Ready for a glute-and-hamstring workout that will help you grow a bigger butt and stronger hamstrings? Then my Backside-Blasting Workout is for you! I'll recommend some set and rep ranges, but you can adjust these based on your goals. If you  want to build more muscle, drop the number of sets and increase the weight. If you want it to be more of a conditioning workout, increase the reps and take some weight off the bar.  This workout is tough and might leave your muscles aching for a few days afterward. If you train legs twice a week like I do, use this workout on your hamstring-and-glute day. Just make sure to allow time for rest and recovery before your next leg day.  Start off with a superset of single-leg cable kick-backs and bodyweight hip thrusts to warm up your muscles. Just be sure not to rush, especially at the peak of contraction. While you don't need to worry about making the negative or descending portion longer than a 2-second count, make sure to squeeze your muscles at the top of the movement. And squeeze at the top for at least 1 second on the bodyweight hip thrust.  The rep range for this superset is fairly low, so you'll want to do the first half with heavier weight. Keeping the rep range lower and upping the weight will encourage muscle growth. Although I'm saying to go heavy, I want you to pick a weight that allows you to perform the exercise correctly and with proper form. Choose a foot stance you're comfortable with. I tend to have a wider stance when I do back squats.  The squat jumps are all about power and help you push yourself. After a compound movement like the back squat, the last thing you likely want to do is jump into something that's cardio-based, so this superset will test your limits.  These are great for building hamstrings and glutes. Focus on the mind-muscle connection and think about where you're pulling from. At the top, push hard, lock out, and squeeze your glutes for complete muscle activation.  You want to hurt, so pick a weight that causes you to struggle a bit and pushes you outside your comfort zone. You're trying to build muscle. Use a weight you'll feel.  I'm a fan of using bodyweight as an exercise tool. The combination of glute bridges and leg curls in this exercise proves that sometimes you don't even need weightâyou can get a good burn just by engaging the muscles correctly. As with all of these exercises, engage your core continuously throughout the movement.  Time for your finisher! You only get 20 seconds of rest between sets. so you'll likely have to choose a lighter weight. Set your ego aside, and don't be too ambitious. After 3-4 sets, I guarantee you will feel the burn. This is an excellent exercise to build your hamstrings and get that sweep on the back of the leg.",Imogen Parfitt's Backside-Blasting Workout
9,"Stiff ankles. As a physical therapist, I hear about this problem all the time. Patients come in with complaints like ""I can't squat below parallel because of my ankles"" or ""If only I had more ankle mobility, I could finally nail that pistol squat!"" Decreased ankle mobility is a common theme, especially among women. Fortunately, understanding the causes and performing mobility drills can help you loosen those joints up. People tend to complain about reduced ankle mobility during one lift in particular: the squatâspecifically, the bottom of the squat. In the bottom (or hole), your ankles need to be fully flexed, known as dorsiflexion. If your range of motion is limited, you won't be able to squat past parallel without being in pain. So, what causes decreased ankle mobility? The major culprits include stiffness at the joint or joint capsule, muscle tension, muscle imbalances, and chronically tight muscles. Ladies, I'm talking to you. If you frequently wear high heels, your ankle range of motion is going to be affected. Your ankle isn't able to move through a full range of motion in heels, which creates stiffness, and you're walking around with shortened calf muscles, which leads to chronically tight calves. Now, this isn't to say that only those of you who wear high heels will have tight calves; there are plenty of other reasons, including muscle imbalances in the feet, legs, or hips; altered gait patterns; and specific techniques such as forefoot running. Regardless of the reason, it's important to address any tightness or imbalance. These mobility drills are simple yet effective ways to improve your ankle mobility so you can rock the bottom position of your squat. The best part: All four exercises can be done in under 6 minutes, so you've got no excuse not include them in you training session. I'm fairly confident you will find a few tender spots that could use your attention by doing this move, specifically in the arch of your foot and in your calf muscles. Oh, and remember when I said that these exercises should not cause any pain? This may be the one exception to that rule. If you are tight here, you are going to find some tender spots. Just be sure to not push too hard (no need to grimace!) and remember to avoid bony areas. This is a great stretch because it not only stretches out your calves but also gets the whole body (including the ankles) moving! This is a fairly simple exercise that achieves improved mobility at the joint itself. Okay, this move sometimes confuses people. If you are wearing lifting shoes or shoes with a high heel, you can more easily get lower in your squat. If this is true, is it also true that wearing these shoes can actually limit your range? As I said before, it comes down to muscle imbalance. We need our muscles to be working efficiently and effectively to provide stability and allow us to move well and through a full range of motion. If our muscles are not doing this job well, other muscles have to kick in to help. Joints will also take some of the role of stabilizing and start to lock down, reducing their range of motion. This is why it is critical to include some specific barefoot training and foot-strengthening exercises in your training program. Does that mean you always have to lift barefoot? Not at all, but it does mean you need to carve out a few minutes every single day to specifically train those feet, ankle, and lower-leg muscles by doing exercises barefoot. Start with this one, a not-always-so-easy way to balance on one foot known as ""short foot."" This simple exercise proves to be very challenging for many people, as it forces all of the smaller muscles of the foot and lower leg to engage and work together. Time yourself, and see how long you can get. Once you feel confident with this exercise, there are so many ways to incorporate this exercise into your barefoot training!",Increase Ankle Mobility For Deeper Squats
10,"In the weight room, ""heavy"" means different things to different people. Regardless of your strength level, this workout will give you the chance to test it—and improve it. After a solid warm-up, you'll work in the low-rep strength zone on the press that allows you to move the most weight: the bench. You'll also give solid attention to your back, shoulders, and core in three back-to-back higher-rep supersets. This workout is very intense and includes a lot of different training styles. I recommend adding it into your routine once or maybe twice a week if working on your upper body is a big goal of yours right now. Let's get started.  <strong>Inchworm:</strong> Keeping your legs straight, reach down to tap your toes, and walk your hands out into a plank position. Once you're in a proper plank, with your body in a straight line from your shoulders to ankles and your core engaged, complete one push-up. Then, walk your toes in toward your hands. Repeat across the floor for reps. <strong>T-spine rotation:</strong> Increase the mobility of your thoracic spine and hips with this sequence. Start in the same position you did for the inch worm, then straighten your legs and walk out into a plank. Bring your right leg to the outside of your right hand. Plant it there as you twist and reach your right arm up. Switch sides and repeat.  <strong>Shoulder sweep:</strong> Lying on your side, bring your knees up toward your chest at a 90-degree angle. Place your right arm out straight at your side, resting it on the floor. Place your left arm above that hand. Reach your left fingertips up and around your head, reaching toward the other side of your body, then bring it back down. The only parts of your body that should be moving are your shoulders and upper back. Keep your knees and your legs steady in that 90-degree position. <strong>Crab reach:</strong> Get on all fours with your chest and upper-body facing toward the sky and your butt facing the ground. Pushing through your heels, reach your arm up and around, grasping behind you. Come back to the center before switching arms. Try to focus on the quality of your movement and not the number of reps completed.  <strong>Barbell bench press:</strong> Ease into this compound movement. Start with 2 warm-up sets, working your way up to 5 working sets of 5 reps. With each set, increase your load by 5 pounds or so, although the first time you perform the workout, it's OK if you don't know exactly what load to use. Keep your hands shoulder-width apart, and as you bring the barbell down to your chest, bring your shoulders back, squeezing and engaging your upper back. Go slow on the way down, make sure the barbell touches your chest, and exhale and explode all the way up. This exercise is meant to build strength. Over time, your focus should be on getting more weight on the bar.  <strong>Dumbbell sumo deadlift high-pull:</strong> With this rep scheme, you'll work more in the hypertrophy range. I want your heart rate to go up, and I want you to work hard. With the sumo deadlift high pull, you'll use two dumbbells. With your feet a little bit wider than shoulder-width apart and your toes facing out, assume a sumo stance. Reach down for the dumbbells by hinging at your hips, pushing your butt back and keeping a soft bend in your knees. Drive with your legs to explode all the way up, bringing the weights to your collarbone. Your elbows should go nice and wide and then reset. Short on dumbbells? Opt for a kettlebell instead.  <strong>Lateral raise:</strong> High pulls already work the shoulders, so supersetting them with lateral raises will really make your delts work. Don't expect to be able to use the same weights you used for the high-pull, though! Keep your feet fairly narrow, right underneath your shoulders, and keep a slight bend in your knees so that you have a strong base of support. I don't want you to bring this into your traps, so definitely keep your shoulders down and away from your ears throughout the movement. If you use heavier weight, you can have a soft bend in your elbows to make it easier to get the weights up there, but try to keep your arms as straight as you can, so you're really working the outside of that delt.  <strong>Single-arm dumbbell row:</strong> While you're working in a slightly higher rep range here than you were with the bench press, I want you to go heavy with this row. Think about driving your elbow up toward the sky and bringing the weight toward your ribcage, squeezing your back at the top.  <strong>Arnold press:</strong> I do a lot of my movements standing, so that my core is engaged, and the Arnold press is no exception. But there's no need to go super stiff; keep a soft bend in your knees as you lift the dumbbells up to your shoulders with your palms facing toward you. As you press the weights up and toward the sky, rotate them so that your palms are facing away from you at the top of the movement. Then, rotate them back around as you bring them back down.  <strong>Kettlebell windmill:</strong> This move might not be a regular in your routine, but it's one of my favorites and a great way strengthen your abdominals while engaging everything from your glutes and hamstrings to your shoulders and triceps. Starting with your right side, face your right toe forward and your left out to the side. Grab the kettlebell in your right hand, bring it toward your shoulder, and press it overhead toward the sky. Don't go too heavy while you're learning this movementâespecially after all those Arnold presses! Hinge at the hips, and stick your butt back, pushing your hips toward the right as you reach your left arm down. Keep your right arm overhead and your eyes on the kettlebell for the entire movement. <strong>Push-up:</strong> With push-ups, small cues can make all the difference. Keep your butt squeezed, and lower your entire body in unison. Think about bringing your nose in front of your fingers rather than in between, leaning over your hands instead of pulling back as you descend. Then, once you get to at least a 90-degree bend in your elbows, or lower if you want, explode back up. ",Alex Silver-Fagan's Strong Moves Upper-Body Workout

12,"Let's face it: one thing that's so appealing about the machines in a gym is that you can effectively hide on them. Nobody's going to give you a puzzled look or come over and ask, ""What body part does that work?"" After all, it's written right there on the machine! But the arena of unique free-weight exercises can be a little intimidating for the self-conscious trainee. This is a shame, because free weights and bars can deliver a far more time-efficient whole-body strengthening workout than one that relies largely on machines. But self-consciousness may be why so many people end up doing the same thing over and over again. They just don't want to deal with it.  <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/franciscadennis/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Francisca Dennis</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ironaphrodite/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lauren Yates</a>, on the other hand, don't mind at all. These two personal trainers, models, and <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/fitmiss.html"">FitMiss athletes</a> do what's effective first and foremost. They're relentless experimenters, unafraid to tinker, and equally unafraid to share what they've learned.   Here are six novel moves they want you to consider when you're ready to give your own workouts a much-needed boost! <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BKmJsYMDaCf/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A video posted by FitMiss (@iamfitmiss)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-09-20T23:26:02+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Sep 20, 2016 at 4:26pm PDT</time> We've nearly reached a point where men and women can do hip thrusts in a conventional gym without getting weird looks—nearly. But the only way to get all the way there is to keep fearlessly doing this peerless backside builder. When a stronger butt and legs are the goal, the hip thrust just plain works.  ""This exercise is a great move to build and lift your butt,"" notes Dennis. ""It will also help prevent back, knee, and ankle pain while improving your athletic performance."" Do you really need another reason to add these to your workout routine?  ""To perform this move properly, you'll want to start with your butt on the ground with your head, shoulders, and back resting on a bench behind you,"" she says. ""From there, hold the bar on your hips—maybe on a squat pad or Airex pad if you're going heavy—and plant your feet shoulder-width apart. Drive through your heels as you thrust your hips up toward the ceiling so that your legs are at a 90-degree angle and your torso is parallel to the ground."" To turn up the heat even more, Dennis recommends squeezing your glutes as hard as possible and holding the contraction briefly while at the top of the movement. ""Do 4 sets of 8-12 reps on glute or leg days for optimal results,"" she says. <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BIIO_WyDLpw/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A video posted by Lauren Yates (@ironaphrodite)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-07-21T15:32:18+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Jul 21, 2016 at 8:32am PDT</time> When you train shoulders, how much attention are you giving your rear delts? If you're like many women, not nearly enough. ""This exercise is very beneficial for women, because you work those rear delts, engage your core, and improve stability,"" says Yates. ""I usually add this exercise to the end of my shoulder or back-day routine, and it's one that I definitely feel working."" To perform this unique move, start off in a plank position. One of your elbows should be 90 degrees on the bench, and your feet should be about shoulder-width apart on the ground. Holding a dumbbell in the other hand with a neutral grip, rotate the weight out and away from the bench. Don't forget to breathe! ""Maintain a slight bend in your elbow while doing this,"" Yates recommends. ""Also, try and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the same time to get the best results from this move."" Once you've contracted as high as possible, lower the weight slowly, inhaling on the way down. <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BJdVIoohFhH/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A video posted by Lauren Yates (@ironaphrodite)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-08-23T16:41:27+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Aug 23, 2016 at 9:41am PDT</time> If you want a better booty, squats are your fastest way there. And this high-volume protocol is sure to challenge you to your limit.  ""This is not only a great exercise for building your legs, but also an awesome conditioning exercise to get that heart rate up,"" says Yates. ""I add this exercise to my leg day as a finisher, but it can be performed at any time during your leg routine."" For the 100-rep squat, she recommends using a weight you can comfortably do for 10-15 reps in a row. She likes to use the equivalent of her own body weight, but depending on how much you can squat and how much you weigh, a different number might be appropriate for you. Once you have this weight loaded, your only assignment is to get 100 reps, racking the weight to rest as needed.  ""It is OK to take breaks, but make sure they last no more than 60-90 seconds,"" Yates says. When she's using her body weight, Yates will aim to get all the reps in across 10 sets of somewhere around 10 reps, but when using less weight, she can put a larger dent in her goal in the first few sets.  ""No matter what weight you use, this should not be easy and make take you some time to complete,"" she says. ""Buckle down for the long haul, keep your form tight, and just focus on getting to that 100th rep!"" <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BIpXxLbh4GD/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A video posted by Francisca (@franciscadennis)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-08-03T12:23:57+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Aug 3, 2016 at 5:23am PDT</time> If you have a love-hate relationship with burpees, you'll be in for a real treat with this exercise. ""Burpees are great, because they're a full-body exercise that torches fat and helps you build upper-body as well as core strength,"" Dennis says. ""I love throwing these in between sets of other exercises to keep my heart rate up."" To make this work with the BOSU, you'll need to stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart so your knees don't come crashing into the hard plastic of the ball. With your arms mostly extended, raise the BOSU over your head, then bring it down to the ground. As you do this, shoot your feet back, fully extending your legs, and perform a push-up before jumping back to the starting position.   Depending on your upper-body strength, you may struggle to bust out the reps at first with this one, but over time, it's great to aim for 15-20 reps in a set. <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/_5CG9FNbqK/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A video posted by Lauren Yates (@ironaphrodite)</a> on <time datetime=""2015-12-29T21:39:59+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Dec 29, 2015 at 1:39pm PST</time> What's cooler than a woman who squats or deadlifts? Not much, but a woman who alternates squats and deadlifts is a close second! If strong legs, back, and booty are on your wish list, you can't go wrong with a superset of wide-stance squats and sumo deadlifts.  ""You're not just hitting your glutes and legs; you're working your core, back, and shoulders as well,"" says Yates. ""Incorporating powerlifting exercises into your routine is also beneficial because they're fun!"" She recommends starting with a lighter weight, because this one-two duo is tough, and it's crucial that you perform both with perfect form. You definitely won't use as much weight while supersetting the two moves as you would if you were just doing the exercises on their own.  ""When doing the sumo squat, keep your abs tight, back straight, and drive up through your heels while focusing on the glutes,"" explains Yates. ""For the deadlift, start with the same foot position, and once again keep your back straight, hips low, and abs tight. Your chest should stay high during both exercises. If you use a mixed grip on the deadlifts, try to remember to alternate hands with each set."" If it sounds like the two exercises share a lot of similarities, that's no coincidence. That means you have fewer cues to remember when the going gets tough! Keep your chest out and proud for both, and on the deadlift in particular, don't skimp on the lockout. Drive those shoulders back and stand tall once the bar passes the knees.  ""I like to perform 5 supersets of 10-15 reps for each exercise,"" says Yates. That's a lot of reps, so rest as necessary. This is no metcon! <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BHCvRTYhHHO/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A video posted by Francisca (@franciscadennis)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-06-24T15:47:32+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Jun 24, 2016 at 8:47am PDT</time> The final last stare-worthy move to add to your workout routine is a variation on the skin-the-cat exercise that adds the negative portion of a toes-to-bar leg raise.  ""This may look like just a core move, but it's far more than that,"" Dennis says. ""It's amazing at building both core and upper-body strength, and it will help improve your grip strength as well."" To perform this one, position your hands approximately shoulder-width apart using an overhand grip on a bar. If your shoulders or elbows prefer an angled bar, palms-facing pull-up bar, or rings, by all means use those. From your hanging position, bend your knees to your chest while contracting your core. Curl back until your feet almost touch the bar or your hips are almost in line with your forearms. Straighten your legs, and slowly lower them until they're at about a 90-degree angle from your upper body. Pause, then curl your legs to your chest once again.  ""This may be really tough at first, but if you build up to doing this one for 3-4 sets of 12 reps during your core workouts, it'll pay off big-time,"" Dennis says.  Once you can knock out reps on any of these, don't be surprised if someone comes up to you and asks what you're doing in an admiring way. When they do, you know where to send them!",6 Unique Moves That Will Transform Your Workout!
13,"Jordan Edwards is no stranger to coming up with workouts that are short on equipment but not short on results. Look at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jordanke/?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her Instagram page</a>, and you'll see her creating impressive full-body workouts with no more than a single cardio step, or a cable stack, or even just a BOSU ball. But her preferred piece of equipment for a single-implement circuit is definitely the barbell—and it doesn't have to be a heavy one.   What's so special about the barbell? Jordan says it's her favorite tool for working her entire body, because there are over 100 different exercises you can do with it, and many flow so seamlessly into one another. Before you know it, your arms, legs, core, and booty are all seriously paying attention.  Looking to get simplified without becoming wimpified? Edwards has six tips to help you burn maximum calories with minimal equipment. ""Training circuit-style with a barbell, where you perform multiple exercises before setting the weight down, is my personal favorite, because it gets me the most tired,"" explains Edwards. ""By doing different exercises back to back, working out your entire body, you get a better workout overall with less time commitment."" A personal favorite move of hers here is to perform a squat or lunge that flows into a shoulder press with the barbell. ""Engaging my leg muscles, then going straight to my delts, saves times and burns calories quickly,"" she says. Squat with heavier weight or lunge with a lighter weight to maximize time under tension. As the reps add up, neither option will be easy! <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BI8xh1xgXyp/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A photo posted by Jordan Edwards (@jordanke)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-08-11T01:14:37+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Aug 10, 2016 at 6:14pm PDT</time> You'll see many circuits that have you perform, say, 10 reps of one move, and then 10 reps of another. Edwards likes to take the opposite approach: 1-2 reps of each move, flowing seamlessly between them, for multiple rounds.  ""Often, I'll do a Romanian deadlift, then move straight into a front squat. From there, I go right into a shoulder press,"" she says. She then repeats this trio for 10 reps, rests for a minute or two, and does another 3 sets of the same sequence.  One benefit of Edwards' flow-focused style of barbell training is that in just about every move you do, you'll be calling your core into play heavily. ""By doing different exercises in the same circuit, you are naturally engaging your core, which in turn gives you a better workout,"" says Edwards. ""This is one reason why I love training full-body workouts with a barbell."" Compound exercises like presses, squats, deadlift variations, and lunges will hit your core plenty during a circuit, but once you're warmed up and in the heat of a circuit, don't be surprised if you feel even simple arm movements in your core, too. With barbells that come in a wide variety of weights, it's not hard to find one that will challenge you maximally at a certain movement. But at all of them? That can be more challenging, and it's where a little bit of expertise from a coach like Edwards can make all the difference.  Wondering how to work your legs with a weight you can also use for a triceps press? Simple: Just emphasize the most difficult portion of the heaviest movement. For example, in the circuit below, Edwards performs a triceps press, then keeps the weight locked overhead while performing jump lunges. All of a sudden, those lunges just got a whole lot heavier! Even with a fairly light weight, the time under tension in a circuit like this one will help you gain muscle and strength while also pushing your muscular endurance to the limit. But don't take that as an excuse to go too light!  ""Make sure your barbell is heavy enough to give you the most effective workout,"" advises Edwards. ""You still have to push yourself. It should be a struggle by the end.""  <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BIYsGJUAcIx/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A photo posted by Jordan Edwards (@jordanke)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-07-28T00:54:29+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Jul 27, 2016 at 5:54pm PDT</time> The best circuits aren't just sneaky-tough core workouts; they're also great at building your booty. But if you want to maximize the effect, it's as simple as getting down low—and staying down there. ""You can get the most effective booty workout by doing a strictly lower-body workout where you transition from a squat to a lunge in the bottom position,"" explains Edwards. ""If you want to really kill your muscles, superset with the same muscle group. This way, they won't have any time to rest."" To be clear, a circuit isn't a complex—and the difference is subtle but important. In a complex, your hands never leave the bar until you've completed all the exercises. In a circuit, you can perform just one movement—or in this case, one series of movements—then set the weight down briefly to rest. Just make sure it's brief!  ""You must have a little rest time in order to have an effective high-intensity workout,"" says Edwards. ""With one piece of equipment, it's a little harder to achieve the right intensity, but by decreasing your rest time and really pushing yourself, you'll find it."" She recommends that you minimize your rest time to around 20 seconds between supersets—just enough to shake it off, pick the weight up, and begin again—or a minute after performing all of the pairings in the series.  <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BJ2o-aVgQjA/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A video posted by Jordan Edwards (@jordanke)</a> on <time datetime=""2016-09-02T12:35:50+00:00"" style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"">Sep 2, 2016 at 5:35am PDT</time> <strong>Circuit:</strong> Perform 10 reps of each exercise combination before moving onto the next. Rest as little as necessary between pairings, or attempt to hold on to the bar for multiple exercise pairings—or a whole pass through the circuit! Once the circuit is finished, rest for 1 minute, then repeat three more times. ",Jordan Edwards' One-Barbell Full-Body Workout!

She was always active and athletic, but when family tragedy struck in 2009, Jessie almost turned her back on the gym. However, with the help of the people closest to her, Jessie quickly realized that fitness was her true calling. Now, as a full-time mom, wife, and the leader of <a href=""http://jessiefitness.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jessiefitness.com</a>, Jessie teaches women everywhere to live a fit lifestyle.  For a workout that will help you feel confident in any dress, look no further. This workout calls for supersets to keep your heart rate up—helping you burn fat and torch calories—and pushes you to lift heavy and build muscle in the 8- to 10-rep range. These are all the ingredients you need for an awesome, fat-burning, muscle-building workout.  In this Rock the Dress routine, you'll work your shoulders, core, arms, glutes, and legs. Time is of the essence, and this workout is no time to slack. Move quickly from exercise to exercise within each superset, resting 45 seconds between each superset. Incorporate this full-body workout into your current routine once or twice a week to crush your fitness goals.  When performing lat pull-downs, you want to hold your torso somewhat steady, and keep back-and-forth movement to a minimum. Grab the bar, engage your lats, retract your shoulder blades, and really focus on activating your back muscles. Feel free to increase the weight each set as you feel comfortable.  Is your grip slipping? Try using hooks or <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/straps.html"">straps</a>. They allow you to focus on your back muscles and lessen limiting factors like grip and forearm strength.  When performing lateral raisess, focus on your form, and keep weight secondary; you don't need a pair of super heavy dumbbells to feel the burn on these. Keep the movement controlled, and use a good tempo throughout the exercise—nice and slow on the way up and down.  When doing lateral raises, place your butt against the bench to help keep your torso steady and keep the focus on your delts.  For chin-ups, focus on bringing down your shoulder blades and engaging your lats before even doing the movement. Don't be surprised if this exercise really taxes your energy systems.  Your biceps are a secondary mover here, so youâre going to get a lot out of this exercise.  If you donât have a workout partner or any assistance machines, you can do these by implementing a rest-pause as needed. After a short breather, just jump back in and finish your set.  This exercise targets your triceps, which stand out when they look great in a dress. As you lower yourself to a slow, controlled tempo, make sure your tailbone stays close to the bench that's behind you. The goal is to dip down far enough to get your upper arms about parallel with the ground.  Need an added challenge? Feel free to increase the weight as you progress with your double-bench weighted dips.  When performing reverse lunge deficit deadlifts, keep the bar close to your body the whole time. As you step back, make sure to move in a slow, controlled manner. Keep your spine rigid, your shoulder blades back, your torso upright, and your lats engaged. Do all reps on one leg before moving on to the other leg.  Not comfortable including the deficit in your workout program just yet? Thatâs OK. Feel free to do these deadlifts on flat ground, and work your way up to the challenge.  Performing preacher curls with a single arm allows you to focus on the biceps and the mind-muscle connection. Go nice and slow with these. Your tempo should be the same on the way up as it is on the way down. Do all reps on one arm before switching to the other arm. Be mindful not to bend your wrist during this movement. If you need to use wrist wraps to keep your wrists nice and solid during the exercise, go for it.  For barbell hip thrusters, keep your feet about shoulder-width apart, your knees at a 90-degree angle, and your toes slightly pointed out. There should be an anterior tilt at the bottom of the exercise, and as you move up in the movement, you should transition to a posterior tilt—tucking your hips up and getting a full glute contraction at the top. Find a resistance band that allows you to push your knees out so that theyâre hip-width apart for the entire exercise. Place the band 1-2 inches above your knees. Doing this allows you to push your knees out during the hamstring curl, making it an awesome exercise for your glutes and hamstrings.  To perform the hamstring-curl portion of this exercise, keep your hips high and your heels on the ball as you drag it as far as you can. Try to get your heels all the way to your hips, then slowly release. Let your hips go down, then start the rep all over again. ",Jessie Hilgenberg's Rock The Dress Workout
16,"Most women, no matter how active they are, have stronger quads than hamstrings and glutes. Think about your typical lower-body workoutâmost movements have some involvement from the quads. Additionally, your quads are activated every time you stand up, walk up a flight of stairs, or simply get out of your car. So it's not uncommon for women to have stronger quads than hammies. In fact, the ideal hamstrings-to-quadriceps strength ratio (H:Q) is 2:3. Your quadsÂ shouldÂ be stronger. Your quads shouldn't beÂ soÂ much stronger, though, that the H:Q ratio falls out of whack. When that happens, your risk for hamstring and knee injuries jumps.[1] That's not the only risk women run, either. Physiological differences such as increased joint laxity, increased estrogen levels, and anatomical differences in pelvic structure and lower extremely alignment (the Q angle) make women much more susceptible to knee injuries than men.[2,3,4,5] The good news? Training the muscles that stabilize the knee joint may help decrease the injury rate observed in females. Not to mention, having weak glutes and hamstrings can also be the cause of the dreaded flat-bottom syndrome. Although women aren't always genetically predisposed to have balanced leg muscles, it doesn't mean you're stuck like that! By training your hamstrings and glutes, you can fix that imbalance, and build more defined legs and a round, firm booty. If you know your lower half needs work, don't hesitate to work your legs twice per week. Concentrate on the weakest parts of your legs. You don't need to do any isolation exercises for your quads. They get enough work from compound movements such as squats and lunges. Annihilate your glutes and hamstrings to increase their strength and symmetry to match your quads. It's tempting to lift with light weight because you don't want to get ""bulky."" When that thought sneaks into your brain, remember that your muscles won't change unless they have a reason to. Muscles respond to stimulus by growing. They won't grow unless you challenge them. By training your hamstrings and glutes, you can fix that imbalance, and build more defined legs and a round, firm booty. And, despite what you may have heard, having more muscle mass will actually help you lean out. It takes a lot of energy for your body to build and maintain those muscles, so you'll be burning more calories without even having to think about it! Leg days are difficult. You might have a love/hate relationship with the gym on those days, but your hard work will pay off! Put these workouts into your regular regimen and enjoy showing off that new pencil skirt! Because you're hitting your legs twice per week, you may want to invest in some supplements likeÂ <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/glutamine.html"">glutamine</a>Â andÂ <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/omega3.html"">omega-3 fatty acids</a>Â to assist your recovery. During periods of heavy training, your body's natural supply of glutamine falls, leading to a compromised immune system and an increased risk for infection.[6] Adding 20-30 g of glutamine to your daily supplement stack may help you recover faster and keep you from having to take any sick days. Add 1,000 mg of omega-3s, which can help reduce inflammation after a hard workout, and you'll be ready to hit that Friday leg workout with all the energy and intensity you had for the Monday workout.[7] Don't worry so much about machines. You can use the abductor/adductor machine if you want, but if you concentrate on sitting back when you squat, and keeping your knees in line with your toes, you'll be working those muscles anyway. Although the deadlift is primarily a back exercise, it's also a fantastic hamstring and glute exercise. Add it to your back day and you'll get a little extra booty blast in the middle of the week.",Leg Workouts For Women: A Girl's Guide To Glam Gams
17,"Out of sight, out of mind? Unfortunately, when it comes to back training, that's the mindset many women seem to have. Too many of us shrug off the essential and necessary exercises in favor of working muscles that we can see in the mirror. That mindset has to go! A strong back is essentialâignore it no more. My back is one of my favorite muscle groups to train. As a fitness competitor, I am judged on my balanced, properly-proportioned physique. Without a strong, well-proportioned back, I wouldn't have a chance of placing well. That means I have to train my back hard and often. Even if you're not stepping on stage, training your back is important because it's a huge part of your muscular system. Wide-Grip Lat Pulldown Our back muscles are involved in just about every move we make each day, so it is important that they are strong enough to handle all of that work. A strong back also provides a solid foundation of strength for other muscle groups. Aside from the strength and functionality benefits of training your back, you'll find that a solid back and well-developed shoulders make your waist look smaller. You'll also have the benefit of not having to worry about the constant fight your back fat has with your bra straps. A good back also means that you'll look great in those trendy, backless styles and little black dresses. Have I convinced you yet? To start, give my ""tried and true"" back training regimen a shot. It's been fundamental to building my physique. I hope it treats you as well as it's treated me:",Jen Jewell's Back-Blasting Workout
18,"Gorgeous gams and a bodacious booty aren't the only prizes you can win with a great workout program. Michelle Obama, Cameron Diaz, and Jessica Biel are a few public figures who have impressed us with their enviable biceps and rockin' delts. It's no joke, ladies. To build a better-looking, stronger, healthier body, you need to lift for your upper body! It is a common misconception that upper-body resistance exercise will cause women to pump up Arnold-style. Fear not, ladies! Women's hormones and physiology such as size and shape determine our strength and muscular development. You're not a professional bodybuilder. You don't have to worry about looking like one. In fact, women only have on average roughly one-tenth the testosterone that men do. Women with higher testosterone levels relative to other women may tend to develop more muscle at a faster rate, but all women can train their upper body without turning into Hulk-ettes. To enhance your physique and create that athletic shape many women crave, you need to build your back, biceps, triceps, and delts! Size aside, the benefits to upper-body resistance training are numerous. Here are just a few reasons you should add it to your training regimen! Bone modeling and remodeling is the process by which bone adapts to load by changing size and shape and removing weak or damaged bone tissue. When muscles contract against bone, it creates stress that causes bones to strengthen against the contractions.[1] The stronger your muscles get, the stronger your bones must become to handle muscle contractions. Bone modeling helps prevent fractures and insures against osteoporosis. Ligaments, tendons, and cartilage are what hold your bones together. These joints are at risk of injury when they become unstable.[2] Upper-body resistance training strengthens connective tissue in the elbows, shoulders, neck, spine, wrists, and hands, improving joint integrity, stability, and injury prevention. Upper-body resistance training strengthens connective tissue in the elbows, shoulders, neck, spine, wrists, and hands, improving joint integrity, stability, and injury prevention Strength exercises increase lean body mass while decreasing fat stores. The greater your proportion of lean mass to fat mass, the more metabolically active your body becomes. A metabolically active body will have increased metabolic rate, fat oxidation, and energy consumption in the form of calories.[3] In other words, you burn more calories and fat simply by carrying more muscle! All things considered, having a strong, shapely upper body improves self-esteem and puts you in the ultimate badass category. In a study published in ""American Journal of Health Promotion,"" researchers found that women who participated in resistance training three days per week improved their body image more than women who walked three days per week (although walking is still much better than sitting on your butt all day).[4] Being strong empowers both your mind and your body. Though we like to associate strength with killing it in the gym, a powerful upper body makes everyday tasks much simpler. You can rearrange your living room furniture without help, carry all your grocery bags in one trip, move boxes without getting a backache, and so much more! Being strong not only feels great, it grants you independence so you can take on bigger daily challenges with ease. These workouts are broken down into push/pull sequences. These workouts are split so that you train both the upper-body push and pull muscles equally during the week. I recommend performing each workout once per week, three days apart, for 4-6 weeks. You can work in lower-body days between these workouts.",30-Minute Upper-Body Workout For Women

20,"Body-part splits are great for some people, but sometimes, you just have enough time to squeeze in one quick full-body workout. If you're feeling rushed, or if you're just looking for a really efficient way to get some solid work done, this 15-minute AMRAP is a great option. I'll guide you through some basic yet very effective bodyweight exercises, and then it's up to you to see how much you can push yourself with them.  The goal of this workout is to really elevate your heart rate and target nearly every muscle in your body. You'll push yourself to exhaustion in minimal time. Best of all, this high-intensity routine can be done on a daily basis. Get ready, and let's do this.  Start with a jump squat to target the biggest muscle groups in your body, raise your heart rate, and get you prepared for the rest of the circuit. These will hit your quads pretty hard—after 20 reps, you'll definitely start to feel the burn.  Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and start by sinking into a regular squat. Make sure to keep your back straight and keep the weight in your heels. Then, jump up explosively, land softly on the balls of your feet, and repeat until you've hit 20 reps.  Push-ups might sound straightforward, but form is everything. When you're in the plank position, make sure you're not pushing your hips too high or letting them sag. Start in a high plank with your hands directly under your shoulders and your core tight. As you lower your body, keep your back flat and your neck in a neutral position. As you push back up to complete the first rep, exhale.  Complete 10 reps in this manner as fast as you can. Struggling to meet the reps with a traditional push-up? Do it from your knees. Never give up on an exercise just because it is challenging. You can always modify.  For each of these 20 reps, drop down on the floor, and then jump up as high as you can. At this point in the workout, you're warmed up and your heart rate is increasing. If you're sweating and out of breath, good! That's what you want. You shouldn't be able to put together a whole sentence at this point.  The fourth exercise is the jump lunge, which works your legs, glutes, and abs. Complete all 10 alternating reps as fast as you can. Remember, the power for this movement comes from your hips. Keep your chest up without rounding your shoulders, and make sure to always land on the balls of your feet.  The last exercise in this circuit is mountain climbers. Mountain climbers are a great finisher, because they're a double whammy that target your core while giving you a great cardiovascular push. For these, complete 20 alternating reps per leg.  At this point, it's hard to remember anything complicated, so just keep these simple cues in mind: Start with your hands in the push-up position, flexing at the knee until one leg is under your hip. As you explosively reverse the position of your legs, extend the bent leg backward until it's straight, and bring in the other foot.  This is just one round. Keep going until the 15-minute countdown is up, and try not to stop or take any breaks. Go through the circuit as many times as you can. Your goal is to complete as many reps as possible.  When you're done, write down your score. Next time you do this workout, you're going to beat that score! ",15 Minutes To Fit: Zuzka Light's Full-Body Workout
21,"A strong core means more than just summer-ready abs and taut obliques—it also means better stabilization of your spine, which benefits you both inside and outside the gym.  Today's 15-minute workout has you going through a circuit of four different ab-focused exercises as many times as you can during the 15-minute countdown. Complete as many total reps as possible. Whether you want to look better, function better, or both, a strong core is essential.  Now, let's get started!  The first exercise in this circuit is plank jacks. Start in the plank position with your hands underneath your shoulders and your hips stacked—not sagging or pushed up too high. While you're in the plank position, jump your feet apart and then back together. Try to complete the reps as quickly as possible.  As you might expect from their name, flying burpees will raise your heart rate. Don't be surprised if you get sweaty and are too out of breath to count your reps aloud. Starting on your back, roll (or fly) up, jump into a plank, do a push-up, and jump up to complete the burpees as fast as you can.  The third exercise in the circuit is done on your exercise mat. Start by lying down on the mat, then sit up and hug your knees. With each squeeze, you'll target your abs. This may sound like a simple exercise, but don't be fooled—it's really intense and very effective.  The last exercise in the circuit is jump tucks. Again, you're raising your heart rate and targeting your abs by tucking your knees as fast as you can when you jump up. Make sure your jumps are dynamic and that you're jumping as high as you can. Your effort levels should be at an all-time high. Tired? Good. This circuit of four exercises represents just one round. Your goal is to complete as many rounds as you can in 15 minutes. When you're completely done, write down the number of reps you completed. Next time you come back to this workout, strive to beat your personal best.",15 Minutes To Fit: Zuzka Light's Amazing Abs Workout
22,"If you want to shape up your glutes and thighs, but you're short on time and space, this workout is for you. Most of us don't have all day to train, but this 15-minute session targets those major muscle groups quickly and effectively so you can get your workout out of the way and get back to your busy day! In this workout, you'll go through a circuit of five different exercises as many times as you can in 15 minutes. The time cap helps you have an end goal in sight and push hard for the entire duration. These exercises are fun, but they're not easy. The combos will elevate your <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/polar/ft1.html"">heart rate</a> and target the biggest muscles on your body. If you want to make these 15 minutes count, it's important to push as hard as you can and do as many rounds as possible. As you get tired, remind yourself that you can handle anything for a mere 15 minutes. The extra effort will pay off, and you'll love how you feel afterward! Don't get scared off by these exercise combinations, either. You can modify these movements as much as you need to, so just do your best to nail each version. The ability to scale this workout and go at your own pace means you have no excuses. Now, let's get fit! This first exercise requires a great deal of balance. Not only will you be lunging backwardâand making sure your knee doesn't pass your toeâbut you'll also be kicking up with your back leg as part of every rep. To stay steady, try and stare at one point directly in front of you. Also, make sure you're kicking as high as you can. One great way to ensure you're bringing your leg to maximum height is to keep a hand raised in front of you and aim to kick into your palm on the way up. Try to keep a strong momentum going for the entire circuit. No lowering your hand, and no cheating! With your feet about shoulder-width apart, squat down to start this movement. Then, jump up as high as you can, landing softly on the balls of your feet. Finish with a leg lift, alternating which leg you raise each time. This exercise primarily works your glutes and thighs, but it also engages your abs. Expect your heart rate to speed up, but avoid the urge to slow down. I want you to push yourself even further than you thought possible. Next up is the pistol squat to deadlift, of which you'll complete 10 reps while alternating legs. For the first part of this movement, focus on tensing all of the muscles in your standing leg. If you can't go all the way down into a pistol, aim to go at least halfway down, but stop at a point where you can still maintain your balance and form. When you're doing your single-leg deadlifts, focus on balance. It's this added stability challenge that really forces you to engage your core muscles. Don't give up on an exercise just because it's challenging. Try to push through, and have fun with it. It's OK to look a little silly! The curtsy lunge to side kick is a lateral movement that's really going to target your glutes. Remember to step one leg behind the other, bending both knees, then kick to the side with the leg that you just lunged with from behind. When you're performing this exercise, focus on keeping your glutes under as much tension as you can. Your last exercise in the circuit is a squat to lunge jump. These 10 reps will fly by since you're quickly transitioning between the squat and the lunge. Make sure not to take any breaks between reps. Once you've completed the final exercise combo, you can take a much-deserved breatherâbut not for too long! Your goal is to complete as many total rounds and reps as possible in 15 minutes. Make a game of tracking your progress. Write your score down; next time you come back to this workout, strive to beat your personal best.",Zuzka Light's 15-Minute Lower-Body Workout
23,"Women start their path to fitness for all kinds of reasons—sometimes the wrong ones—but often discover their true motivation later in the journey. With every weight lifted, crunch completed, and rep logged, they discover a growing sense of accomplishment and self-worth. And this confidence comes in different forms. Yes, it's cool to be able to lift 200 pounds off the ground—and I like to do it—but it's also cool to jump around, sweat, and just feel good. There's room for all of this and more. I'm Alex Silver-Fagan. I'm a Cellucor and Bodybuilding.com athlete, a personal trainer, and a group fitness instructor at CityRow in New York City. I've competed in the past, which I think is a good goal, but by no means does it equal living a fit lifestyle. Today, I do a little of everything: bodybuilding, CrossFit, yoga, running, powerlifting, and circuit training. My fast-and-dirty circuit is how I think circuits should be: quick and effective. This workout gets your heart rate up and can be either the cardio portion of a heavy lifting day, or stand alone as a total-body fat-burning workout. You'll work in different planes of motion while also increasing your metabolism. This circuit comprises 3-4 rounds of six total-body complex movements. It's going to be fast: 20-25 minutes with minimal rest. All you need is a set of dumbbells, a bench for your feet, and a good attitude.  You're going to kick this workout off with one of the best—I didn't say most fun!—movements: the burpee. Drop down to the ground, bring your chest to the floor, and pop back up. Make sure to stay nice and low so that you can go straight into the side-to-side shuffle.  Moving laterally isn't something most people do in their day-to-day life, but that's exactly why you need it in your training. Once you complete your side shuffle, drop down and do another burpee. That's rep 2. Continue this metabolic movement until you've completed 8 reps.  Now it's time to pick up some dumbbells. Pick up one weight with your right hand and stand in a split-squat stance with your left foot in front and your right leg behind. For this primarily lower-body movement, make sure to drive through your front heel, working the glute, keeping your torso straight and aligned and your core tight. Lunge down and explode with the weight as you come up. Switch sides, placing the weight in your left hand with your right foot forward and left foot back.  Make sure that you have a wide-enough base of support that your body moves down vertically when you lunge, not wavering front and back. Your knee should not go over your toe.  As an added bonus, pressing a weight overhead means you're engaging your abs, too. This is a true full-body movement!  So you think you're good at push-ups? Let's put it to the test. Place your feet on a bench or a step and get into a decline push-up position. Make sure your shoulders are over your wrists. Bring one knee to your opposite elbow. Do this on both sides for one complete rep.  With this movement, you'll be working your entire upper body while hitting your abdominals and obliques. Just remember to really drive your knee all the way to your triceps so you get a full crunch and total engagement.  Squatting is one of the most basic, primal movements, and it belongs in every workout. For this squat variation, place both weights in front of your chest and keep your feet underneath your hips. You don't need a super-wide stance; just turn your toes out slightly. Sit all the way back into a squat, bringing your butt all the way down.  As you come up, press and rotate to one side. Make sure to come on to your toes as you rotate to really achieve full extension of your entire body. Renegade rows are a tough movement—a lot tougher than they might look at first glance. Even I don't look forward to writing them into my own workout. But I recognize this dread as a sign that I should do renegade rows—and so should you.  Keeping your hips steady, get in a plank position. Your shoulders should be over your wrists and the weights directly underneath. Make sure you're not leaning back too far; you want to be right on top of the weights and maintain a wide, supportive stance. Bring one weight up to your chest in a row, and then bring it back down.  A great cue is to think of bringing your elbow, not your wrist, up to the sky. Keep your hips square like two headlights pointed at the ground, and squeeze your glutes to help keep your core firing and lower body engaged.  A few reps in, you'll discover that this is a movement that works <i>everything</i>. See a trend developing here?  All of the previous exercises in this circuit were core-incorporating movements. This is a core-focused movement. You'll know the difference a few reps in, I promise.  Sit on the ground and hold the weight horizontally between your hands. Keep your arms extended upward, and roll down until your upper back touches the floor and you tap the weight behind your head. Before you come back up, bring your left leg up and flex your foot. Reach for that toe with the weight 8 times. Then, switch sides.  Make sure you're not bending your arms too much and that you are getting that full reach. If you have limited shoulder mobility and need to modify the movement, bring the weight to your chest and then roll up. I want you to find what works for you. After all, you've got at least another couple of rounds to go!",Alex Silver-Fagan's Fast-And-Dirty Circuit Workout
24,"I have a confession to make. Years ago in high school, I was made fun of for having no butt. It hurt—especially because it was true. But it also motivated me to do something about it. That was one of my initial pushes to get seriously into training, and eventually into being a trainer.  A funny thing about butts, though: As I became older and wiser, I learned that the importance of having a strong butt didn't end with aesthetics. It really only started there.  There are multiple reasons why every woman (and man) should work their butt ""on"" rather than ""off"" this year. The question is, how to do it? Sure, you could take the kitchen-sink approach with all types of free weights and all of the machines, but it doesn't have to be that complicated. As I explained in ""<a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kettlebells-and-bodyweight-the-perfect-pairing"">Kettlebells and Bodyweight: The Perfect Pairing</a>,"" the kettlebell is ideally suited to building strength where the sun don't shine—and doing it efficiently.  I've included two workouts below for women with different goals for their unique backsides. Both are brief, intense, and won't require you to wait around for someone to get off of the booty blaster.  The glutes are the centerpiece of your body in more ways than one. Strength radiates out from them, supporting both your upper and lower body. The weaker your glutes, the greater your chances of injuring your back, knees, hamstrings, and groin muscles.  Back pain in particular often results from having weak glutes that aren't capable of doing much more than hang there. Stuart McGill, PhD, an expert on spine biomechanics, has popularized the term ""gluteal amnesia"" to describe the condition. It sounds silly, but it's no joke! In ""Low Back Disorders,"" McGill writes that ""People with trouble backs, generally walk, sit, stand and lift using mechanics that increase the back loads. They tend to have more motion in their back and less motion in their hips. [This is] a common aberrant motor pattern known as gluteal amnesia.""<sup>1</sup>  Translation: When your glutes are weak and you don't know how to lift properly, your back has to chip in. That may not lead to you being in pain right away, but over the course of months or years, it probably will.  When that ""sproing"" moment inevitably happens, people often start obsessing over stretching their back, when the real solution was in front of them—or rather, behind them— all along. In fact, I would argue that preventing back pain is reason enough to focus on building strong glutes—and proper movement patterns, of course. But your reward isn't only a lack of pain. Athletes with strong glutes tend to be faster, more explosive, and more efficient. They can do more with better form, adding more lean-body mass and burning more fat along the way. Plus, the exercises that develop strong glutes, such as kettlebell swings, squats, and deadlifts, all have tremendous carryover into daily activities and other training.  Different people's body parts respond to strength training in different ways. Some things get bigger on some people, while some stay the same size. But pretty much without exception, a stronger butt is a more shapely butt. You may not build a butt like that one you like (or that you're afraid of) on Instagram, but you can definitely make a firmer, rounder version of your current one! And honestly, while people talk a lot about size, shape is what matters to most of us.  Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin actually investigated this, and they found men aren't as drawn to the size of the tush so much as a certain curvature that offers the look of a shapely butt.<sup>2</sup> So let's talk about what you need to do!  First things first: While nobody seems to want to say it, the same exercise and nutrition protocol can have dramatically different effects on different individuals. People act like this isn't the case online, but those of us who work with actual people know it's true.  I've had many women come to me who were fearful of doing squats because just staring at a squat rack might cause them to no longer fit into their jeans. I like to refer to these ladies as BME for ""builds muscle easily."" Let's not dismiss the BME women as some kind of myth—let's work with them! For BMEs, I have found that a lower-volume leg program and some tweaks to their nutrition generally results in their jeans still fitting (if that's what they want). In the other camp, there are the skinny-legged women who can't seem to put on muscle to save their life, even when they lift heavy. Their program has to include much more volume than their BME friends' just to see a slight change. What's to blame for the difference? Mostly genetics, but distribution of muscle-fiber types and variations in hormone levels can all play a role in how much muscle you pack on.  It's not fair, right? But the truth of the matter is that you should always follow a lifting program that works best for your goals, abilities, and yes, your body type!  Now before you worry that I'm trying to turn you into some kind of buttzilla professional bodybuilder, I'm not. If that's your goal, more power to you. But I can promise you one thing: That kind of muscle doesn't happen on accident! I'm including two simple butt-emphasis workouts for two different goals. Both should be approachable for a woman of any level of fitness after she learns the proper technique.  Beginners should start with a smaller kettlebell, somewhere around 18-25 pounds. If that's far bigger than the one you've been using, great! Intermediate and advanced lifters with some kettlebell experience can start with more challenging sizes, such as 35-53 pounds.  This higher-volume routine is designed for the woman who wants to lift and develop nice gluteal muscles, but who generally struggles to put muscle on.  Be forewarned: Your glutes will be sore after this! If you're new to glute work, I suggest you don't try all five rounds of paired sets your first time through. Start with two rounds, then work your way up. You should feel like you're working at 80 percent of your work capacity once your form and technique are solid.  One other thing: Don't skip the warm-up! Those two movements are great for getting the glutes firing after sitting on them all day. This routine is for the woman who perhaps tends to carry more weight in her hips and butt, and is sensitive about adding more muscle to that area. She wants to have a firmer rear end, but doesn't want it to get much (or any) bigger. Go through each exercise one after the next. Take just enough rest to recover for the next exercise. It's OK if your heart rate is high throughout; just don't let it take away from the quality of your movement. Choose a challenging weight that feels like you are working at around 80 percent of your capacity.

25,"My workouts are tough, hard hitting, and all about functionality. This leg workout is no different. I designed it to help you improve the explosive power of your lower body and to help you get better at doing the things we do every day, like picking things up off the ground and walking around with weight in your hands. Anyone—guy or gal—who wants to develop stronger glutes and hamstrings will benefit from doing this high-volume workout. I suggest you implement it into your current training program 1-2 times per week. No need to do it more than that.  Because this workout is built on supersets, your heart rate will remain high through the entire workout. So, not only will you build strength, you'll also improve your overall fitness and conditioning, helping you build a super body!  I think it's really important to do a good warm-up before a workout like this. Because you're lifting fairly heavy weight and including plyometric exercises, your hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings, and quads need to be warm and ready to move. Do not skip the warm-up and dive right into the sumo deadlifts!  Now, I prefer the sumo deadlift because I feel like it works my glutes and hamstrings better than the conventional dead. However, you can do whatever you feel most comfortable with. As you go through each set, add weight. Try to work up to 80 percent of your one-rep max. The deadlift is a complex, powerful movement, and it's a fantastic way to strengthen your posterior chain.  During the first superset, use a box that allows you to hit parallel on your squats. Don't rock back and forth when you hit the box. Touch your butt to the box, and then explode up. Use weight that's challenging; those 5 reps should be tough! Move immediately to jump squats, and jump as high as you can. Your legs should be burning, and you should feel out of breath.  The two exercises in the second superset will work your glutes and hamstrings. That's why I put them together. During Romanian deadlifts, keep your feet under your hips and move your butt back. Keep your neck in a neutral position by looking down. On the kettlebell swings, hinge your hips the same way—push them back, then thrust them forward. The weight should move because your hips do, not because your arms do.  During the third and final superset, use weight that makes the lunges challenging, but not impossible. Don't let your front knee collapse in as you walk. When you get to the step-ups, use a bench or box that is high enough to be difficult. They should have your legs burning. Don't quit!

I designed it to help you improve the explosive power of your lower body and to help you get better at doing the things we do every day, like picking things up off the ground and walking around with weight in your hands. Anyoneâguy or galâwho wants to develop stronger glutes and hamstrings will benefit from doing this high-volume workout. I suggest you implement it into your current training program 1-2 times per week. No need to do it more than that. Because this workout is built on supersets, your heart rate will remain high through the entire workout. So, not only will you build strength, you'll also improve your overall fitness and conditioning, helping you build a super body! I think it's really important to do a good warm-up before a workout like this. Because you're lifting fairly heavy weight and including plyometric exercises, your hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings, and quads need to be warm and ready to move. Do not skip the warm-up and dive right into the sumo deadlifts! Now, I prefer the sumo deadlift because I feel like it works my glutes and hamstrings better than the conventional dead. However, you can do whatever you feel most comfortable with. As you go through each set, add weight. Try to work up to 80 percent of your one-rep max. The deadlift is a complex, powerful movement, and it's a fantastic way to strengthen your posterior chain. I prefer the sumo deadlift because I feel like it works my glutes and hamstrings better than the conventional dead. However, you can do whatever you feel most comfortable with. During the first superset, use a box that allows you to hit parallel on your squats. Don't rock back and forth when you hit the box. Touch your butt to the box, and then explode up. Use weight that's challenging; those 5 reps should be tough! Move immediately to jump squats, and jump as high as you can. Your legs should be burning, and you should feel out of breath. The two exercises in the second superset will work your glutes and hamstrings. That's why I put them together. During Romanian deadlifts, keep your feet under your hips and move your butt back. Keep your neck in a neutral position by looking down. On the kettlebell swings, hinge your hips the same wayâpush them back, then thrust them forward. The weight should move because your hips do, not because your arms do. During the third and final superset, use weight that makes the lunges challenging, but not impossible. Don't let your front knee collapse in as you walk. When you get to the step-ups, use a bench or box that is high enough to be difficult. They should have your legs burning. Don't quit! Your results will be well worth the effort!",Superset Your Way To Super Legs
27,"Many trainees believe they need a minimum of 30 minutes for an effective workout. And that's just the <i>minimum</i>! This ""more is better"" mentality leads many people to spend up to two hours in the gym before they think they've done ""enough.""   If you have that kind of time, spending it in the gym isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, if something unexpected pops up—sick kid, work emergency, car trouble, or any of life's other frequent curveballs—to interrupt your schedule, it's easy to get discouraged and skip your workout altogether. When life springs a surprise on you, don't give up on your day's fitness goals. You can actually perform an effective workout with only 15 minutes to spare! But before you start throwing shorter workouts into your schedule with abandon, it's important to learn a few simple rules so you can make the absolute most of your time.  If you're short on time, using the best exercise is non-negotiable; after all, you need to get the most out of your time. Use large, compound exercises such as squats or step-ups instead of isolation moves like leg extensions and leg curls. For your upper body, perform push-ups and inverted rows instead of triceps kick-backs and dumbbell curls.  These compound exercises activate more muscle groups and require more energy to perform than their isolation counterparts, making them the best choice when you're short on time. Heck, even if you're building a full workout, you should generally focus it on compound moves. They simply give you the most bang for your training buck.  Once you've chosen the right exercises, you need to use the right load and the right effort. Work hard by using a challenging load and putting 100 percent focus and effort into every rep you perform. You don't have time to waste on reps that are too easy or done poorly.  However, it's also important to be smart. Never sacrifice proper exercise form for more weight or more reps. Even though you're only training for 15 minutes, you shouldn't rush your reps. Doing so will only hamper your results and increase your chance of injury. Take your time and stay focused.  To make the most of your short workouts, don't perform the same type of movement over and over. It's also important not to neglect large areas of your body. If you only do air squats and push-ups, for example, you're totally neglecting the back side of your body.  My favorite way to train my body evenly is to do three-exercise circuits that utilize a lower-body exercise, an upper-body pull, and an upper-body push. Try these two templates. Using them will ensure you have an effective, balanced, total-body workout each time you train.  The exercises you use depend on the equipment you have available, as well as your personal preferences. For example, if you don't have time to make it to the gym, choose <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/your-simple-guide-to-awesome-non-gym-workouts.html"">bodyweight exercises</a> you can do at home, or wherever you happen to be. If you're in a hotel gym that only has dumbbells, use a combination of dumbbell and bodyweight exercises. If you can, use both templates equally.  Now that you know the rules and have two great templates to use for your 15-minute workouts, here are several sample workouts you can perform whenever you're short on time! Choose one of the templates and fill it with whatever exercises you want or have the equipment for. Perform as many circuits of that template as possible in 15 minutes. In other words, perform one exercise after the other, continually, for 15 minutes. Rest only if or when you need to. Once the timer goes off, you're done. The rep range is up to you. You can choose to use heavier weights and perform sets of 6 reps, which is great for a strength focus, or sets of 12 reps, which is great for building muscle or general physical fitness. Select three exercises according to the templates, and set a timer for 15 minutes. At the top of every minute, you'll perform a set of one of those exercises. For example, when the timer starts, you'll do a set of Exercise A. Rest until the top of the next minute rolls around, then do a set of Exercise B. Rest until the top of the next minute, and do a set of Exercise C. Repeat this pattern for a total of 15 minutes. Once again, you can use any rep range. Perform sets of 5, 10, or even 15 reps. Begin with Template 1 and perform as many circuits as possible in six minutes. Yes, only six minutes. Work hard and keep rest to a bare minimum. I suggest using a lower rep range for this first circuit—around 5-8 reps is a good range.  Once you complete as many circuits as possible of Template 1, rest for 1-2 minutes. Then, perform as many circuits as possible in six minutes of Template 2. For this round, I suggest using a higher rep range—10-15 reps is a good target. You may think six minutes isn't enough time, but if you work hard and keep rest to a minimum, you'll quickly see how much you can really achieve when you focus and work hard! When you're super short on time or you need to change up your current routine, you now have several viable options! From today forward, you never have to miss a workout again because you ""only have 15 minutes!""  ",How To Build The Perfect 15-Minute Workout

In fact, a study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that a mere 10-minute battle-rope workout increases heart rate to peak levels and should be classed as high-intensity exercise. These long, thick ropes work your cardio levels to the max while enhancing your grip, strength, conditioning, and overall level of work capacity. They're great for cardio and general physical fitness.  When maneuvering battle ropes in a variety of both linear and circular motions, the idea is to peak your heart rate. High-intensity interval-style regimens that focus on improving your power, explosiveness, and aerobic endurance are where battle ropes really shine. They're an essential part of your recipe for creating a calorie expenditure that will have your body fat falling at record speed!  Another benefit of battle ropes is that they're a great low-impact form of training anyone can do to even out strength imbalances and improve balance.  In case you needed even more incentive to give a calorie-culling rope workout a crack, just know that they're fun as hell. Give this session a try, and trust us—you'll be back for more!  <strong>Works:</strong> Core <strong>How To:</strong> Start in the push-up position, placing your arms, not your hands, on the ground. As you maintain a neutral position with your neck and spine, squeeze your glutes and allow them to assist you in the move while you tighten your abdominals. Remember to breathe. As you hold the position, create a strong parallel line from head to toe.   <strong>Works:</strong> Glutes, core, quads, hamstrings, calves, shoulders <strong>How To:</strong> Begin in a squat position with your hands on the floor in front of you. Kick your feet behind you so you're in a push-up position. Return your feet to the squat position, then leap up as high as you can, throwing your arms above your head. That's one burpee. Next, explosively jump sideways, clearing each end of the rope individually. Make sure the ends of the rope are approximately two feet apart. Once clear of both ends of the rope, perform one burpee and continue in the opposing direction. <strong>Works:</strong> Glutes, core, quads, hamstrings, calves, shoulders <strong>How To:</strong> With your left or right arm, perform a single-arm wave while holding the end of the battle rope with your arm fully extended and elbow locked. As you do each wave, you'll assist the movement with a powerful jump squat. <strong>Works:</strong> Glutes, core, quads, hamstrings, calves, shoulders <strong>How To:</strong> Begin this exercise by sitting against a wall with your hips and knees at a 90-degree angle and your back in full contact with the wall. Keep your neck and back straight while you hold the end of the rope in both hands, maneuvering it in a crisscross pattern. Be sure to keep your weight on your heels and off your toes to avoid pressure on your knees. <strong>Works:</strong> Glutes, core, quads, hamstrings, calves, shoulders, triceps, chest <strong>How To:</strong> Begin in a deep squat, holding both ends of the rope. Drive your hips up as you extend your knees fully in an explosive standing position while using both arms in a powerful, upward-wave motion. Do two explosive squats, each with a two-sided explosive wave. Then drop straight to the ground to do two chest-to-floor push-ups.",Torch Body Fat With Battle Ropes!
29,"As a mother, wife, and fitness professional, I lead a pretty hectic life. My days are full of caring for my son, spending time with my husband, and working on my career—probably just like many of you! And, like you, sometimes, I'm so busy I hardly have time to make it to the gym! When those extra busy days roll in, I like to whip out one of these full-body circuit workouts. I can do them at home, at the gym, or if I'm travelling, even in my hotel room. The great thing is that these workouts will work in a pinch for you, too!  I really like these circuits because they train the entire body and are intense enough that they also provide a great cardiovascular workout! If you're tired of the treadmill and want to use one of these puppies on a normal lifting day, you can even add one of the workouts as your post-weight-training cardio session.  Don't get too crazy, though. I suggest doing only one of these workouts per day. If you're not sweating buckets after you complete one, then you definitely need to increase the intensity or increase the number of rounds you perform!",Jamie Eason's One-Dumbbell Circuit Workouts!
30,"The goal of this upper-body workout is to build shapely muscle over time. You're going to superset every exercise—or perform two exercises back to back, without rest—and hit all the major muscles on your upper half: shoulders, chest, back, biceps, and triceps! If you work hard and keep your rest periods short, this should only take you 30-45 minutes. This workout is perfect for people who need a quick training session or who like to follow an upper-body/lower-body split. You can add a cardiovascular challenge by adding one-minute bursts of cardio—burpees, jump rope, box jumps, and other bodyweight exercises—between each superset, or you can do high-intensity intervals (HIIT) at the end of the workout. Try this workout a few times as written to get a good feel for it. When it gets too easy, increase the weight, decrease the rest periods, or change some of the exercises. I think you can make this session work for you no matter what! <strong>Note:</strong> Don't rest between exercises, but rest about 30 seconds between each superset I'm not pushing for a ton of reps on these exercises because I know many women who can't perform a full pull-up by themselves. However, I want you to do the best you can by completing the full range of motion through both movements, so feel free to use an assistance machine or bands. You can also use a box and do jump pull-ups. As much as possible, perform both exercises nice and slowly. Squeeze your lats to pull yourself up on the pull-up, drop slowly on the dips, and keep your arms close to your body. These two movements can be very difficult, but if you can do them unassisted, do! I like to bring my dumbbells over to the seated-row machine so I can get both of these exercises in quickly. If someone wants to work in, though, it's best to do the chest press elsewhere. To do the row, lean back about 45-degrees and pull your elbows straight back. Squeeze your shoulder blades together. Go slow. If it feels too easy, increase the weight on the next set. Don't be afraid to challenge yourself. Although it's not always popular for women to train chest, it's an important part of developing a balanced, symmetrical physique. Control the weights throughout each rep of the chest press. Get a nice stretch at the bottom of the movement, and squeeze your chest at the top. Lean back about 45 degrees on the lat pull-down machine and pull the bar straight down until it touches your chest. Don't use your momentum to move the weight. Pull from your lats and move the weight slowly. To perform the dumbbell pull-over, lay your upper back over a bench and keep your hips low. Allow the weight to fall back behind your head, then pull it back up and over your chest. You'll feel a big stretch and contraction. Although there are many ways to do a rear-delt raise, I prefer to do them bent over and seated. Your rear delts are a small muscle. You can't use a lot of weight while maintaining good form, so don't go too heavy. Drop your shoulders and keep your shoulder blades contracted as you do the movement. Lateral raises are also difficult, so you may need to drop the weight midway through the set. Keep your shoulders down—don't hunch them up. Concentrate on only using your delts to move the weight. To do a ""W"" curl, put your elbows right into your sides and curl the weight upward. Your arms will follow the shape of a ""W."" These curls hit your biceps a little differently than the normal biceps curl. I like this movement because, by keeping your elbows at your sides, you're less likely to use momentum to move the weight. I like to use a static exercise as a biceps finisher. This alternating static curl is one of my favorite moves! Keep one arm flexed at 90 degrees, and curl with the other arm. Both hands should be holding the same amount of weight. Now that you have an effective workout for your goals, get into the gym and use it. This workout is perfect for anyone—even beginners can do it. You have no excuse.

31,"The Stairmaster is a great tool for cardio, but climbing a never-ending staircase with no view can be boring as hell. If you're suffering from stair-machine burnout, take a break! My Sucking-Wind Workout will get you out of the gym, into the sunshine, and up some <i>real</i> stairs. You can incorporate this cardio workout into your routine when the weather is nice, but I think exercising outdoors, even if it's a little chilly, beats a dirty exercise machine in a smelly gym any day. The best thing about this workout is that you only need a pair of running shoes and a nice, wide set of stairs. If you live in the city, you probably have a flight of stairs nearby that will work. For instance, I used the steps of the state capitol building. The workout consists of five different exercises, done for 10 sets of about 50 feet each. It's tough, but it's going to challenge your cardiovascular endurance, your balance, and your coordination. So, it's not only great for overall conditioning, but also for overall fitness! Stand at the bottom of the stairs and drop immediately into a push-up, resting your hands several steps up. After the push-up, jump your feet all the way up to the step right below your hands, keeping your feet together. Repeat this until you get to the top of the stairs. When you get to the top of the stairs, that's one set. Run back down to the bottom and repeat 9 more times. This could easily be called the bunny hop! Jump up two steps at a time with your feet together, landing on every other step. Don't be afraid to use your arms to give yourself a bit of momentum. Run down to the bottom of the steps and repeat 9 more times. Face sideways and put the foot nearest to the staircase on the first step. Then, cross the lower foot over the upper foot so it lands on the stair above. From there, step the bottom foot to the stair above the top foot. On your next step, instead of moving your bottom foot over your top foot, cross it behind the top foot so it lands on the step above. Do 5 sets facing to the right, and 5 facing to the left. Alternate crossing your back foot over and behind the lead foot. The grapevine is a little more technical than the other exercises we're doing in this workout, so you may want to take it slow and practice the move on flat ground first. Stand on your right foot and bend your left leg so your left foot dangles around midcalf. Swing your arms and hop up the stairs. Switch legs each time you hop up the stairs. You'll really feel these in your calves, so I recommend stretching ahead of time. Try to get up the steps as quickly as you can. Bounding sprints are surprisingly fun! All you have to do is sprint up the stairs as fast as you can, taking the steps 3-4 at a time. This is a great finisher exercise because you're really elevating your heart rate and pushing your whole body to the max. You have the workout, now all you need is a set of stairs and the right attitude. You may have to do this workout in public, but don't let it bother you.

32,"I once thought the only way I could get in a good workout was in a gym with all the necessary barbells, benches, and dumbbells at my disposal. I wouldn't even go on vacation without first quickly searching the area we'd be staying in for a gym. Thankfully, I've come to realize that, in order to train hard and keep getting results, it's not how much equipment you have that matters, but rather making the most of what you <i>do</i> have. And believe it or not, you have more options than you think. No matter if you're on vacation or feeling like your gym has become your dungeon, you can perform a fantastic workout with limited or even no equipment. So, when you're on your next vacation, traveling excursion, or just want to play outside, here are some rules to follow and workouts to try! Some of my favorite workouts take place outside in the fresh air and sunshine. There's just something incredibly rewarding and invigorating about training outside. Perhaps it's because your nostrils aren't constantly bombarded by the smell of stale sweat, chalk dust, and bro. As different and fun as outdoor workouts are, they still require a little bit of thought. The first rule of limited-equipment or outdoor workouts is balance. No, I'm not talking about balancing on a wobble board. I'm talking about training all of your muscle groups equally. Most of us push more often than we pull, and many women are guilty of focusing more on their legs than on their upper body. This often leads to muscle imbalances and bad posture, so it's important to train each body part proportionally. Doing just those three exercises will provide a balanced, total-body workout. However, in order to perform a balanced workout, you must use what's around you. Are you near a hill? That would be perfect for some sprints. Is there a sturdy bench? That's great for things like step-ups and elevated push-ups. Are you near a playground? Now we're talking! You can do myriad exercises with a swingset and jungle gym. For example, you can do <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSuKfRXEpSA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">push-ups</a>, (elevating your hands on some of the playground equipment if necessary), pull-ups or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=51&amp;v=wiSQ8yrTAKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inverted rows</a>, and even assisted pistol squats. When it comes to outdoor workouts you're only limited by your imagination. If you have a couple of dumbbells or kettlebells at your disposal, you can be even more creative with your workouts. Remember, it's all about making the most of what you have to work with and not worrying about what you don't. If you only have a single dumbbell or kettlebell, here's a sample workout you can try: If you have two kettlebells or dumbbells, try this one: Another option—and one of my personal favorites—is to not work out at all. No, I'm not telling you to just sit on your butt and binge-watch your favorite shows, I'm telling you to go <i>play</i> outside. It's a great way to work out without feeling like you're working out! All you have to do is look out your window. Go for a hike in a nearby national park, bike ride through your city, or try longboarding. If you're near a beach you can swim, snorkel, take a long walk, or do sprints in the sand. Maybe you have a hidden passion for kayaking! The specifics are less important than these simple truths: When you like doing something, it's easy to make it a hobby. And fit hobbies make a healthy lifestyle the easiest thing in the world! <span style=""border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% / 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer;"">Save</span>",Your Simple Guide To Awesome Non-Gym Workouts

""I just switched over to a two-a-day program in which I train for strength in the morning and follow that up with a growth-focused hypertrophy session in the afternoon."" For this fitness model, who has always considered herself an ""8-reps-or-higher kind of girl,"" the morning sessions have taken some getting used to. ""This is the first time I've done true strength training, where you work in a super-low rep range and lift heavy enough to only push out 3-5 reps max,"" she says. ""I was curious how this kind of training would shape my body differently, so I thought, why not test the waters and give it a try?"" Samantha's morning strength workouts are based on compound movements—things like snatches, power cleans, pull-ups, squats, deadlifts, and push presses. ""I alternate between upper and lower body depending on the day, and I pick 3-4 moves and build up to a very heavy weight,"" she says. ""I can't get more than 3-4 reps most times, and sometimes I push until I reach my 2-rep max. I take longer breaks between my sets to fully recover, then go at it again."" While she uses her mornings to try something new, Samantha still lifts to sculpt her muscles in the afternoon.

""If I find myself surpassing that 15-rep mark, I take things up a notch and use a heavier weight,"" she adds. This, paired with short, sweet rest periods of no more than 30 seconds, makes her workouts cardiovascular and saves her from endless treadmill plodding. ""These workouts also give me a great pump,"" Leete says. ""I especially love this arm workout, which is crazy effective for sculpting your bis and tris."" Whether you're looking to train for strength or hypertrophy, this is the perfect arm workout. It's great to do when the gym is super busy and all the machines and cables are occupied. All you need is a set of dumbbells, a small cambered barbell, and a flat bench. With those tools, you're good to go. ""I recommend warming up for about five minutes with your choice of cardio,"" Samantha says. ""It's good to get your blood moving, shake off the day, and settle into the idea of training. I usually opt for a jog on the treadmill. Once you're warm, set up your little corner and begin."" High Protein/Quality Calorie Shake To Supplement Healthy Meals And Snacks! The first move in Leete's workout is a pretty standard one: a standing dumbbell curl. The twist? ""I tweak the reps a little to help produce a crazy pump,"" Samantha says. ""One single set consists of 12 reps done simultaneously with both arms, then 6 alternating reps per arm immediately afterwards. I rest 30 seconds, and then hit it again for a total of 4 sets. I keep my pace even and controlled and really focus on the squeeze at the top of the movement. This helps me to recruit more muscle fibers, forces them to work as hard as they can, and gets as much blood into the muscle as possible."" With my next move, you'll single things out with a seated concentration curl. ""I again focus on getting a pump, but in a different way: I do a one-second curl to the top followed by a four-second negative to lower to the starting position,"" Samantha says. ""With negatives, you can use a slightly heavier weight than normal. Keep that in mind when crushing 4 sets of these."" Next, give your biceps a chance to recover by hitting your triceps. You'll use the same negative technique with skullcrushers and a cambered barbell. ""I start at the top with my arms extended, then lower the barbell slowly toward my forehead for four counts,"" Samantha says. ""Then I extend up quickly for one count, continuing that pattern for 10-15 reps. It's important here not to choose too heavy of a weight. Unless you have a spotter, you don't want to fail with a barbell hovering over your forehead! Pick a weight you know you can get at least 10 reps with and adjust from there."" Bent-over double-arm dumbbell triceps extensions are next. ""As with my very first move, I do a set of 12 reps with both hands together, then 6 single reps on each arm to force a pump and exhaust my triceps completely,"" Samantha explains. ""With extensions, remember that your elbows need to stay high the whole time; don't let your arms slide down as the reps get tougher!"" ""I like to finish my arm workout with a dropset superset of one biceps and one triceps move as a burnout,"" Leete says. ""The more I can exhaust these muscles, the more they will need to rebuild themselves, and the better chance I have of shaping them the way I want."" So how does a dropset superset work? ""I do one dropset of a seated biceps dumbbell curl, then one dropset of a seated triceps overhead extension,"" Samantha says. ""Then I rest for 60 seconds, and repeat for a total of 3 sets. For each dropset, I shoot for 10-12 reps per drop, decreasing my weight by 2-5 pounds each time."" That kind of volume gives you great bang for your buck and will leave you feeling the workout. ""At the end of this dropset, I'm lucky if I can pick up a pencil to write in my workout log!""

Before I start my workout, I make sure I get a really good stretch, especially for my IT band and hip flexors, since these muscles are heavily involved in the movements. To prepare for this squat-rack session, grab a <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/best-gym-towels.html"">gym towel</a> or stretch band, if available. This quick routine aims to improve your flexibility and keeps your muscles functioning within a full range of motion. First, you'll stretch the IT band and glutes. Lie on your back, raise one leg straight into the air, and wrap the band or towel underfoot. This gives you leverage to push your leg against to really pull on those tight muscles. By moving your outstretched leg around and to the side, you will feel a decent stretch on the hamstrings and glutes. To emphasize the IT band more, cross and bend the leg to the opposite side of your body, as if you're trying to place your foot on the floor. Next, to stretch your hip flexors, lie on your elbows, pull one leg into the body with the knee pointing outward, and keep the other leg completely outstretched. Push your stretched leg back to emphasize that hip flexor. Switch to get the other side. It's time stretch out your back and upper body. Wrap a towel around a sturdy pole and slowly back up, leaving your arms outstretched and butt back. Keep your back from arching and feel the stretch in your lats and upper back. Next, stretch your chest. Using a towel or band around a sturdy pole, hold onto the band with one arm and twist your body to one side in a lunge position. Switch to the other arm to even out the arms and pectorals. As a final stretch before the heavy work begins, I like to place one arm behind my head and stretch out the triceps. Don't forget to hit both arms! Once you're warmed up and ready, it's time to get to work! Again, aim for 3 sets per exercise within the 8-10 rep range for each. Keep rest between 45-90 seconds. The idea is to keep things moving at a pace that's right for your individual fitness level. If you need to take breaks, take them, but keep them short. Before you load the bar with any weight, set safety pins just below the depth of your squat. This way, if you have to bail, you can safely do so. This setup also allows you to release the weight and tension for one quick second at the bottom, and then explode back up to the starting position. This recruits more muscle fibers in the working muscles. Take a weight belt or chains and wrap them around yourself securely. This isn't a traditional pull-up: I want you to jump up to position your chin above the bar, and then <i>very slowly</i> and in a controlled manner descend to work on the eccentric (negative) portion of the pull-up. Count 5-8 seconds on the way down. This will help build a strong pull-up and strengthen your lats and accompanying back muscles. You can choose to do a power clean or a hang clean, the latter of which eliminates the first part of the movement. This is a full-body movement that demands speed and power. It's a highly technical move, so be sure to practice it with lighter weights than usual. The starting position of the power clean is like a deadlift, although you have a slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip and your knees flared out to the sides. In one quick movement, drive your heels into the ground, pulling the bar up as you do so, and simultaneously drive your hips forward. You want to generate the majority of force from your hips. Imagine that the bar is traveling straight upward along an imaginary vertical line. Rather than muscling up the bar, the bar should shoot up from the powerful hip drive. Once the bar reaches chin height, get your body under the bar and ""catch it"" with your hands by jabbing your elbows forward. As I said, this is a highly technical movement and will require a bit of practice before you get it down. I recommend going heavy on this one and loading up the weight to blast the shoulders. Again, the push press is almost a full-body movement, recruiting a bit of leg drive to get heavier weights overhead. At the top of the push press, lean your head forward a little bit and flex your triceps to stabilize the weight. Not only is this a great exercise for your shoulders, but it also forces your core to work harder than a seated press. This modified bench press is also commonly referred to as a floor press. The floor press calls for a lot more upper body recruitment because you can't utilize the heel drive you normally would on a bench press. Drop your elbows to a 90-degree angle before you push the weight back up. Since you'll be on the floor, I highly recommend bumper plates so you can get under the bar; otherwise, set up the safety racks. Perform this classic triceps blaster with a barbell. Using a close-grip, lower the bar to your head and use your triceps to force the weight back up. Imagine that your whole upper body—except for your forearms—cannot move; this way, you isolate the right muscles in the exercise. Aside from the funny name, the good morning is a great hamstring exercise. For beginners, the bar weight alone should be enough to light up your posterior chain, which includes everything from your hamstrings to your lower back. Set up like you would for a squat, but rather than lowering your butt, bend your knees slightly and push your butt straight back while bending at the waist. Squeeze your butt and drive your hips forward to return to the starting position. Don't go too heavy on the weight as you get used to this movement to avoid injuring your lower back. Last but not least, it's time to hit your core hard. This is a great core and upper-body exercise, and a great finisher to this entire routine! Get on your knees and rest your hands on a loaded barbell. Push your hips forward to roll the barbell out with your arms extended as far as you can. Now it's time to brace your core, keep your spine straight, and roll the barbell back toward you for a count of one. That's one rep. I'm sure you got a great workout! Your body will hate me, but you'll also learn to love me. Remember that your training will never get easier; you'll just keep getting better.",Ashley Horner's Full-Body Squat Rack Workout!
35,"When most women approach their trainers with their results wish list, they hope for a firmer stomach, shapelier glutes and thinner thighs. Trainers almost never hear a woman say, ""I want a firmer chest."" In fact, most females are under the impression that chest training should be left out of the picture! To these women, chest development should be left to the men. They're afraid chest training will make them less feminine. Ladies, that thought process is junk! Just trash it. If you want a complete program and a body to be proud of, you need to include chest training. These busted myths and programming tips will help you get past your fears and lead you to a chest revelation! This myth gets perpetuated because female bodybuilders sometimes hit the stage with flat-looking chests that are far from what we normally deem feminine. It's not the muscle that makes their breasts smaller; it's the extreme diet. Most bodybuilders walk on stage with body fat levels that are far lower than what's considered healthy for a female. Breasts are primarily fatty tissue, so when body fat levels go way down, so do breasts. Aside from the women who have implants, most fitness and bodybuilding competitors just don't have enough body fat to keep their bras full. Don't be afraid to press serious iron, girls. As long as you sustain body fat levels that are well within a healthy range, you won't have an issue. According to the American Council on Exercise, women need to have at least 10-13% body fat for ""basic physical and physiological health."" Dipping below 10% (for ladies) may bring ""underfat"" health risks. This myth just makes me laugh. Supposedly, with some bench pressing, your breasts will go from soft to rock hard. Who needs a sports bra now? Training your pecs will build muscle underneath the fat makes up your breasts. As long as you aren't dieting too severely, your fat mass should remain. If anything, the added muscle helps your breasts appear fuller and might actually give a little boost to your cleavage! Most women add push-ups to their regular routine as an afterthought and then wonder why their upper body isn't looking better. As with any other muscle group, you need a sufficient level of exercise variety and weight resistance training in your program. A combination of bench press, incline bench press, cable or dumbbell flyes and push-ups is the variation and difficulty you should be aiming for. Once you reach a certain level of fatigue, push-ups aren't going to do much for maximizing strength gains. Unless you put a plate on your back or find some other way to add resistance to push-ups, they're not going to help you get stronger. Instead, add them to the end of your workout as a finisher. Now that we've covered what not to worry about, here's what you need to know about chest training: Depending on your current workout split, you can work your chest muscles up to 2-to-3 times per week. Make sure you take a day off between workouts. If you're using an upper/lower body split, add this chest workout to your upper body days. If you're feeling really frisky and want to add other compound movements before the accessory lifts, go for it.",A Girl's Gotta Bench: Chest Workout And Training Tips
36,"How many times have you heard this question: ""How much can you bench?"" For most women, the answer is probably never. Considering that we were only given the right to vote 91 years ago, change comes slowly for the majority of women -- especially changing minds about fitness, lifting weights and the right and wrong things women do at the gym. So chest training -- various forms of bench press and chest flyes -- usually falls to the bottom of the list for women. Or it falls off entirely. Who wants to look manly with a big chest anyway? That's the prevailing myth about women and weight training. But -- and now I'm talking directly to the women out there -- to completely avoid chest training is simply a bad idea. And this article will tell you why.[ Honestly, does that look like a manly chest to you? On top of that, I'm going to help you out and try to ease your fears of chest training. I'll give you a basic chest workout that will get your heart rate up, help you build overall upper-body strength, and flesh out your training program so you can achieve the bombshell bod of your dreams. Let's say you decide to forgo chest training entirely, but you still train your back, arms, core and legs. Such an off-balance training routine could end up developing muscular imbalances in your body. This could lead to bad posture, a stringy or bony looking chest, and inability to perform other exercises correctly. You might even seriously injure yourself one day trying to do an exercise that involves some chest muscles that can't pull -- or in this case, push -- their own weight. I'm not arguing for benching near your max every time you hit the gym. In fact, I prefer a chest workout that is tailored for females -- basically it's going to be closer to full-body training or using compound movements that hit the chest, shoulders and triceps. Whether you want to be strong enough to move into your new apartment on your own, develop athletic skills for a specific sport, or sculpt a cover-model physique -- your chest muscles will play a part in your training schedule.[ Don't be a dip. Bench pressing can help you build up those triceps too. In fact, if you've ever coveted beautiful, round shoulders on other women or kick-butt triceps, you might be surprised to find out that chest workouts really help develop those body parts! Often you can lift a lot more weight when doing chest exercises than when doing triceps or shoulder isolation moves alone. Plus, there's a bonus calorie burn! Since the chest is such a large muscle area, training it will burn more calories than training smaller muscle groups. Chest exercises lead to a better rate of burning fat! Now, how is that not convincing? The exercises that every women should incorporate for chest training are: Â  Only three exercises? I wrote this whole plan and mention only 3 exercises?! Yeah, yeah -- I admit it; chest training can be basic and highly effective. But isn't that the beauty of it? You probably don't have to change your routine much to add in these exercises, and your body will reap the benefits. If basic push-ups are too easy, there are many ways to increase the intensity. You can do decline push-ups, one-handed push-ups, or push-ups on an exercise ball-for just a few ideas. Note on rep range: For bench press on flat, incline or decline, challenge yourself with a rep range of 6 to 8. Always start with a warm-up set of 15 reps before hitting a heavier set. For chest flyes and close-grip bench press, do 10 to 12 reps. Do push-ups failure, meaning going until you can't complete one more push-up. Â  You can train chest once or twice a week. You don't need to train chest more than twice in one week, unless you're doing a full-body workout three times a week. And if you're doing full-body workouts, no need to do all three chest exercises. Pick one or two to round out your workout. Depending on your workout split, you might train chest on, say, Wednesday and Sunday. Here are two ways you can combine the above exercises into a quick-but-effective chest workout. Hopefully you can see how easy it is to incorporate chest training into your overall gym strategy. Many women are afraid of looking overly masculine, but chest training isn't the necessary culprit. It just so happens that when you cut down body fat, you may go down a bra size, or even 2 or 3 sizes. Yes, ladies, those lady-lumps are made out of fat, not muscle. For many women, this isn't a problem. Reaching your ideal level of fitness usually brings awesome benefits like high-energy, self-confidence and a general, ""I feel great all the time!"" attitude. So this is what basic training is like? The lesson here is this: Don't blame the hard-knocked chest exercises. Chest training will help you avoid injury and build a well-rounded and strength-balanced body. And it's everything else you do inside and outside of the gym that will determine your overall look. Chest training is one piece of the fitness puzzle that can't be left out if you want to reveal an amazing body at the end.",Why Women Can't Afford To Avoid Chest Training!
